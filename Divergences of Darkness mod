A mod for Victoria II with Heart of Darkness Expansion that continues the legacy of Divergences : An Alter Vicky mod created by Kinniken 


According to the quantum theory, every decision made in the universe creates an alternative universe where all the following events take a different way. The first decision that diverged the timeline is called the Point of Divergence.

In the Divergences mod there are PODs that are not bound to each other:
- The duke of Burgundy decides to continue his support for Plantagenets in the Hundred Years' War
- The personal union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden survives and evolves to a unitary state
- Isabella of Spain married a Portuguese prince, instead of Ferdinand II.
- The Chenghua Emperor does not stop Ming China's explorations, but decides to pursue them with greater zeal than before
But that were not all the changes. The timeline began to diverge more and more and after 400 years the very world as we know it looks absolutely different...

In perpetual beta some might say but slowly advancing toward a polished version. 

What needs to be done ? 
- Graphics : you like the mod and are good with graphics such as making images for events/decisions then you can always contribute 
- Finishing the Dual-Monarchy events and decisions (first on the list) 
- Making new colonial nations in Africa. 
- Adding colonial interactions between the Great Power in Asia to create a Great Game ITTL 
- Redoing the map to make it more distinct from the real wolrd
- Always more flavor for countries ! 
Feel free to contribute in those areas if you know a bit of code and if you have suggestions you can always tell them here or on the official thread : https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/divergences-of-darkness.743333/

Aussi hélas pas de traduction française mais si quelqu'un esst motivé il a mes encouragements !
