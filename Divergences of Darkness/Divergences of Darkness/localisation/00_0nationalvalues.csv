switch_to_productivity_desc;Ours is a wealthy nation filled with industrious, driven people. Each man pushes himself to do better, for the betterment of all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME18501;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Way;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18501;Ours is a nation of equality, where no man is placed above another in importance. Everyone strives for the betterment of all. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a wealthy but criminal industrialist has served not to outrage the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, but rather to reinforce their ideals. Today our people walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME18505;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Ingenuity;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18506;Ours is a nation of liberty, where every man is born with the inherent right to seek his own destiny. The possibility of prosperity lies within every man's reach. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the acquittal of a man popularly believed to be innocent has served to reinforce our peoples' ideals. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME18507;The Price of Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18507;It has been often said that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are accustomed to freedom-- they strive for it, hold it as the greatest of ideals. So it is that they chafe under the yoke of what they see as the government's tyranny. A recent demonstration in one of our cities threatens to spread throughout the state. With the eyes of the world upon us, however, forcefully putting an end to this act of civil disobedience will no doubt be seen as an attack upon our own citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18510;Military Parade;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18510;In the eyes of our soldiers as they parade through the streets, nothing can be seen but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$ and the ideals for which our nation stands. These men, and the description fits them, have been fostered since childhood into rigid and firm belief in our nation, and they would die to defend it. Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC18511;Ours is a nation of might, where a man's strength determines his success and everyone knows very well how superior we are to our neighbours. None can hope to compare to $COUNTRY$ on our best day. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the execution of a foreigner believed to have been engaged in criminal activities on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soil has served to reinforce our peoples' beliefs. Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME18515;Send in the Troops;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18515;Matters in $COUNTRY$ are getting out of hand. Acts of violence are becoming more commonplace, and some claim that revolution is in the air. Many citizens in $CAPITAL$ are calling on the government to take stronger measures. Sending our army to deal with the violence will, however, only bring the attention of the world upon us. Perhaps this is a time to prove that $COUNTRY$ can deal with its affairs in the way we always have-- with civility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC18517;Ours is a nation of order, where peace and civility rule the day. Everyone strives for the common good, and for the progress of our nation as a whole. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a prominent criminal figure who had previously eluded authorities has not outraged the people, but rather has served to reinforce their beliefs. Today the people of $COUNTRY$ walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18521;Brotherhood of Man;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18521;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: peace, brotherhood and fraternity. Such were the virtues this man believed in, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18525;Liberty Shines;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18525;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: freedom, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Such were the virtues in which this man believed, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18530;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18531;A recent dispute with one of our neighbours has had an electrifying effect upon the people of $COUNTRY$: 'How can they be allowed to treat us this way?', they ask. Some are calling for war, while others are satisfied with the knowledge that our nation has already come out on top.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME18535;Onward to Tomorrow;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18535;A celebration in $CAPITAL$ took place this month, a sombre affair following the death of a prominent politician. This was a celebration of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way: order, industry and productivity. Such were the virtues in which this man believed, and it is a belief shared by all the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18540;Charting the Course of $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18540;Now that we have embraced westernization, we must choose the path that $COUNTRY$'s people will take in the years to come. What civilized ideal will we hold to?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME18550;Rejecting Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18550;Our people have attempted to embrace the ideals of westernization for a long time, but now there is a growing movement to return to the traditional $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. It falls to the nation's leaders to set the example: should we embrace the ideal of tradition once again, or should westernization remain our goal despite our continuing isolation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME18551;Embracing Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18551;Our people have held to our traditions for a very long time. After many years of exposure to the western nations, however, a growing movement has begun to change the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. Intellectuals in $CAPITAL$ say the government should lead the people into an era of progress and not remain mired in our backward ways. Shall we throw these fools into prison, or consider what they have to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18555;Clash of Ideals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18555;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have clashed with members of the aristocracy in $CAPITAL$. The aristocracy has accused the intellectual elite of attempting to cast aside the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life, while the intellectuals say that progress is necessary if $COUNTRY$ is to have any chance against western imperialist powers. The argument of the intellectuals is convincing, but this has not calmed matters in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME18556;New Ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18556;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have brought several new ideas before the court, ideas that could advance our research considerably. They are also quite contentious, however, and a rejection of the intellectuals could do much to soothe the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18560;Annals of the Past;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18560;The peasants are taking to the streets, rising up against their rulers in ways that would have been unthinkable only decades ago. Perhaps it is time to remind them of their duty to their nation, and of the traditions which have served $COUNTRY$ so well in ages past?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME18561;Celebration in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18561;A great celebration has been held in $CAPITAL$ in honor of $COUNTRY$'s rulers, as well as its centuries of honorable tradition. Massive crowds appeared to cheer on our soldiers, and the spectacle has even drawn the attention of foreigners. Shall we dedicate the celebration to $COUNTRY$'s greatness, or shall we instead use it as an excuse to appease the masses?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18562;The Fight Against Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18562;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionaries have begun heated debates in one of our states, arguing that $COUNTRY$ should not be slavishly seeking to chase after 'civilized' nations-- indeed, that already $COUNTRY$ has gone too far down the path of degradation and that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people suffer for it. They are calling on the government to repeal reforms, or at the very least to slow down the rapid pace of change... and they are gaining a wide audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME18565;A Return to Western Influence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18565;$COUNTRY$ is a nation of progress, and our current period of insulation against the western powers runs contrary to that ideal. Shall we call on the borders to be opened once again? It might anger some of our people, but the flow of goods and ideas is invaluable to our prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME18571;Rejecting the West?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC18571;We never wanted this contact with the westerners. They bring too many problems into our country, and their influence spreads like an insidious disease. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court are calling for the borders to be closed once again, for us to display to these imperialists that they cannot simply strut about our nation as if they own it. A display of force is necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
