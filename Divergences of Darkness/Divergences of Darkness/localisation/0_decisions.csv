restore_valois_italy_title;Restore our Rule over Italy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
restore_valois_italy_desc;After the defeat of the Valois dynasty in the Hundred Years' War and the following annexation of their holdings, Provence became their last stand. But thanks to the Valois effective marriage policy, they quickly established control over the Duchy of Tuscany and the County of Ferrara. This was seen as a disturbance of power balance not only by Guelphs and Ghibellines, but even by the Crown of Aragon. The following war between the Valois Coalition (Provence, Genoa, Tuscany, Ferrara) and the Alliance of Naples (Aragon, the Papal States, Milan) led to the end of the Valois expansion in Italy. As the result of the war, their Italian holdings were confiscated and their relatives were expelled from Italy. Also, the annexation of Corsica by Aragon led to its complete control over the West  Mediterranean trade and the beginning of the decline of the Genoan Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

holy_crown_HUN_desc;The Holy Crown of Hungary, the very embodiment of our state is in the hands of the Bohemian Kings who still like to pretend they are claimants to the throne.

form_iberia_title;Propose an Iberian union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_iberia_desc;"Uniting Iberia was one of the ambitions of medieval monarchs of the Iberian peninsula. Sancho III of Navarre and Alfonso VII of León and Castile both took the title Imperator Totius Hispaniae, meaning ""Emperor of All Hispania"" centuries before. But with the rise of the Dual Monarchy in the East it was too dangerous for Castille to extend its territories and instead of the planned union with Aragon, the Kingdom of Hispania was created by merging the crowns of Castille and Portugal.

AFG_punjab_title;The gate of India;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AFG_punjab_desc;The conquest of Punjab was fierce but the lack of leadership amongst the Panjabis after the death of Ranjit Singh allowed us to take control of many territories along the Indus.

enact_female_suffrage_title;Enact Woman's Suffrage;Droit de vote des femmes;Frauenwahlrecht verfügen;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_female_suffrage_desc;The idea of Woman's Suffrage increasingly gained traction in Western society throughout the 19th century. First advocated in the writings of early liberal philosophers, such as England's Mary Woolstonecraft or John Stuart Mill, the idea and ideology of Woman's Suffrage gradually developed, as the century wore on, into a coherent ideology in its own right: Feminism. The experience during The First World War, of women working in factories, and other jobs previously reserved for men during peacetime, is often said to have been a crucial pivot point in securing Woman's right to work, vote, and, in other fields of society, achieve legal equality with men.;Au XIXe siècle, la question du droit de vote des femmes gagne de plus en plus de terrain. Initialement défendue dans les écrits des premiers philosophes libéraux, parmi lesquels les britanniques Mary Woolstonecraft ou John Stuart Mill, l'idée du droit de vote des femmes s'est progressivement répandue au fil du siècle pour donner lieu à une idéologie à part entière : le féminisme. L'expérience de la Première Guerre mondiale, lorsque les femmes travaillèrent en usine et exercèrent des métiers jusque là réservés aux hommes, serait l'un des pivots du droit des femmes à travailler, à voter et, dans d'autres domaines de la société, à atteindre un statut d'égalité avec les hommes.;Die Idee des Frauenwahlrechts fasste im Verlauft des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts in der westlichen Gesellschaft immer mehr Fuß. Zuerst von frühen liberalen Philosophen wie Englands Mary Woolstonecraft oder John Stuart Mill unterstützt, entwickelte sich die Idee und Ideologie des Frauenwahlrechts im weiteren Verlauf des Jahrhundert allmählich zu einer eigenen, kohärenten Ideologie, dem Feminismus. Die Erfahrungen des ersten Weltkriegs, als Frauen in Fabriken und anderen Berufen die Rollen der Männer einnahmen, werden oft als Wendepunkt für das Recht der Frauen auf Arbeit, Wahlrecht, Gleichberechtigung und andere gesellschaftliche Aspekte bezeichnet.;;;;;;;;;;;

sponsor_transcontinental_desc;The links between Porto Novo and Nova Lisboa are tenuous at best, and it is with great difficulty that people travel from one ocean to another in Lusitania. The advent of the railroads could alleviate this problem if we were to sponsor a company that would link the two cities and the two seas. It would moreover dynamize relations with Qingqiu in the West and the rest of Arcadia to the East.;;;;;;;;;;x

reclaim_croatia_desc;The fate of Croatia and Hungary were linked for centuries following the personal union of the two kingdoms and the crowning of László I.

It is now time we made our own claims on Croatia and once again gain access to the sea !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
