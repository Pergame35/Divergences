reclaim_occitania_desc;Even now that we are king of Italy we can't forget our claims in France. Our state is the reunion of many cultures, the French and Occitan having the same rights than the Italians we have united. We can't establish a Dual-Monarchy of France-Italy for now but we could claim the Mediterranean provinces of the usurpers. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

venetians_culture_desc;The people under the government of the Serenissima have distinguished themselves from their Italians brothers because of their ties with the East. But now that Venice is in the hands of the Italian Nation, it is our duty to fully integrate them into our national fabric;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dominium_maris_baltici_desc; The greatest aspiration of the Kalmar Union has always been the complete control of the Baltic Sea.

kurland_annexation_desc; The last obstacle to our complete domination of the Baltic sea is the small state of Kourland. For too long, we have let them pursue a semi-independant policy and it is now time to reclaim their full integration in the kingdom ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

treaty_of_Corfu_desc;The Doge has been unable to take back the mainland. The war which erupted a while ago is drawing on its end and we are winning ! Aragon and Bohemia have offered to mediate in our advantage the signature of a treaty which will push Venice out of Hellas. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
222120.T; Flight to Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
222120.D; The defeat is total for the Venetians. They have been pushed away from their homeland by the Italian nationalists. But they still hold many holdings in the East, where their government fled. Upon entering the city of Athens, the Doge was forced by the Greeks to proclaim an Hellenic Republic while still holding his old title. A new state has emerged from the ashes of the Serenessima, what will it become ?  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
ENL1.T;English nationalism ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL1.D;Upset by what they feel is French domination over the Dual-Monarchy, a group of English intellectuals have formed an organization designed to remove these influences from the Plantagenet king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL2.T;The Glorious Revolution ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL2.D;Because of the spread of both liberal and nationalist ideas throughout England, the English people have revolted against the Plantagenet Monarchy. They have established a republic uniting the English, Welsh and even Anglois people under St-George's Cross. Paris has already stated that they will reconquer their rightful domain. How will this Glorious Revolution turn ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL3.T;Retreat from England  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL3.D;We have been unable to retake England from the Jacobites. We are forced to surrender our claims to the English territory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL4.T;The Irish Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL4.D;Inspired by the English revolution the Irish have declared their independence and are now in open revolt. We could declare war on them right now but it would be a nuisance in our effort to retake England. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL1.T;The restoration of order in Etruria ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL1.D;The republic of Etruria is the threat to the Italian Order. While Aragon is reluctant to go to war against them, we haven't forgotten our right to the grand duchy of Tuscany. The various monarchs of North Italy would not react to this declaration because we would erase a threat to their personal power but Aragon would be angered by our demonstration of force. What do we choose ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
lucca_war_title;Pre-eminence in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
lucca_war_desc;The liberal republic of Etruria has been reduced to ashes with the King in France reclaiming his inheritance of Tuscany. But the duchy of Lucca has not accepted our renewed role in the area, proclaiming being freed from any feudal links toward us. While it is an obscure claim, we could always press it to strengthen our rule in Italy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL3.T;The Provencal Demands ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL3.D;The grand-duke of Tuscany and king of France has threatened us to press his rightful claim to our duchy if we do not bow to him. Many people in Italy would be eager to help us if the Valois would invade our duchy and a new anti-Valois league is slowly forming. Perhaps we are strong enough to force them to fall back ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL4.T;The Luccan league;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL4.D;We have been contacted by the duke of Lucca who has been threatened at multiple times by the king in France. He asks us to join a league against the Valois and free Tuscany from their hands if they dared take any action against the duchy. What do we do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL5.T;The Luccan league;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL5.D;The Valois have taken back Florence. Threatened by the renewed threat in the region, Lucca has asked us to back them against the ambitions of the kings in France. What do we do ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VAL7.T;Response from Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL7.D;The duke of Lucca has refused to bow to our demands. Moreover he has apparently received the support of the various Italian principalites against us. We could take the chances and froce all Italians to bow before us but it would be a long and difficult war or we can still fall back our claims;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL8.T;Response from Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL8.D;The duke of Lucca has bowed to our demands. We are now in control of Lucca in all but name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VAL12.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL12.D;A new war has erupted in Italy. Having regained Tuscany, the king in France has tried to extend his influence throughout the Italian states. But the Italian princes have now allied against him, and their armies are trying to push him out of Italy. This war puts the dream of a Valois kingdom of Italy at great risk, however if the Valois ever win this war, it could mark the birth of a new power in Southern Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL13.T;The Italian crown ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL13.D;Merging the Italian and Aragon crowns has been our goals for centuries. The pesky kings in France have claimed the Italian crown and are stirring the South Italian to revolt. We can't allow it. If we ever want to remain a great power then we must annex this upstart state in the North ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL14.T;The Italian war of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL14.D;The king of Aragon has refused to acknowledge our right to the Italian Crown. They have issued a declaration of war against us to "take what is theirs". This war will define the very future of Italy. Will the Valois succeed or will the crown of Aragon emerge victorious ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL15.T;Savoyard Intervention ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL15.D;We have stayed out the Italian war until now, but it is now our duty to free Tuscany. The duke of Lucca has fled to our court begging our support in the war which he has lost for now ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL16.T;Savoy enters the arena;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL16.D;The duke of Savoy, angered by the reunion of Lucca to our duchy has entered the Italian war, promising to make us leave Italy forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL17.T;The end of the Valois  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL17.D;Provence has lived long enough. At least it's what the Dual-Monarchy thinks. Diplomatically isolated since the decaying of Aragon, this little state which still defies the Plantagenet will be crushed. For St-Denis and St-Georges, let us end the Hundred Years War forever ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE1.T;Greek Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE1.D; Venice's hold of Greece has been tedious since the beginning of the occupation during the Ottoman collapse. With the liberal movement gaining weight at home, the Greek nationalists have become more audacious over time. They reclaim an assembly of all Greeks to decide their future in the Republic. If this council is not held, this could lead to the rise of a rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE2.T; Opening of the Council of Athens ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE2.D; The Greek council finally opens in Athens, the magnificent city of Ancient Greece. Three great factions have formed over the previous months : the Zimisceses, followers of the general who helped Venice "protect" Greece 20 years ago, who want to establish an independent Greek state, the Exarchates, who want to acquire more autonomy, and the Pireans or "Italians", loyalists of Venice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE3.T; The result of the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE3.D; It is finally the end of the Council, what will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE4.T; The Council of Athens : Zimisceses' victory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE4.D; The Zimisceses have won the majority of the votes during the Council. Zimisces has profited from the occasion to declare the independance of Greece, and has rallied most of the Greek soldiers around him ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE5.T; The Council of Athens : Exarchates' victory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE5.D; The Exarchates have won the majority of the votes during the Council. They now ask for autonomy under the protection of Venice. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
GRE6.T; Failure of the Exarchates' proposition ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE6.D; Venice refusing Home Rule for the Greeks has led the Exarchates to rally with the Zimisceses and to proclaim the independence of Greece. Most of continental Greece is already in their control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE7.T; The Council of Athens : Pireans' Victory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE7.D; Unexpectedly, the Venetians loyalists won the majority of the vote during the Council. They are ready to stay under the government of Venice but only if Venice reforms itself and give the same political rights to Greeks as the Italians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE8.T; Pireans failure ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE8.D; Venice has refused the chart proposed by the Loyalists. It has discredited them and most of the Greek representatives have rallied around Zimisces. Nearly all of continental Greece is now under their control ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE9.T; Council of Athens : No majority ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE9.D; No majority has emerged from the Council. Angered by the indecision of the politicians, the Greek general and war hero Zimisces has rallied his supportes in Thessalia and Attica and is determined to deliver Greece from the Italian oppressors. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE17.D; The Cypriots have proclaimed the island of Cyprus to be a full part of Greece !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE18.T; The treaty of Corfu ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE18.D; The war with Greece has been lost. Guaranteed by Aragon and Bohemia, Zimisces has forces the signature of an humiliating treaty on the island of Corfu. Greece will be independent and Venice will free the territories under its control and relinquish any claims on Greek territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE19.T; The Constitution ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE19.D; Greece has won its independence by the treaty of Corfu, but now a new problem arises. Zimisces has had all powers during the revolution but not everybody is ready to agree with it. A new Greek council has been called in Delphi to settle the question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE20.T; Greek Rebellion Crushed ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE20.D; Venice has reclaimed all rebels' territory ! Zimisces has been arrested and executed in the city of Athens. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE29.T; A new council ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE29.D; Greece has won its independence, but now a new problem arises. Zimisces has had all powers during the revolution but not everybody is ready to agree with it. A new Greek council has been called in Delphi to settle the question ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE30.T; Zimisces' rebels ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE30.D; After the interdiction of the council of Athens, Greek nationalists have radicalized. They founded the secret society of Filiki Eteria and recruited new members all over the Greek terriory. They rose led by the general and war hero Zimisces who has proclaimed the independance of a new Greek state !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE31.T; Pireans' Victory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE31.D; Cyprus has chosen to stay under Venice dominion ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE40.T; Opening of the Delphi Council  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE40.D; A new council is held in Greece. This time, the Greek representatives have assembled to discuss the draft of a constitution and there are already different factions opposing each other. First the Zimisceses, who defend a strong monarchy under Zimisces, the war hero and current leader of the state. There is also the Alexandros faction, who support the election of the king of Macedonia to the Greek throne but with more restrictions on the power of monarch. Finally the Pericles faction which wants to institute a real Republic. No matter what the result will be, the shadow of Zimisces is always present and he could try to take power for himself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE41.T; Opening of the Delphi Council ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE41.D; It is the end of the Delphi Council ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE42.T; Delphi Council : Zimisceses resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE42.D; The Greek representatives have decided to give the power to the current leader Konstantinos Zimisces, who will be crowned king of the Hellens. An assembly will be called, and political liberties are guaranteed but the king retains much of the power ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE43.T; Delphi Council : Alexandros resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE43.D; The Greek representatives have chosen to unite with Macedonia. But it will be at the coast of many political reforms asked by the liberals. Moreover Zimisces seems to be ready to launch a coup to claim power. What will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE44.T; The crown of Greece ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE44.D; The Supporters of the Macedonian king have succeeded during the council of Athens. But they are saying that in exchange of the crown, the monarch will have to rescind its power and give a democratic assembly to the people and stop the multicultural policy started in Macedonia. That's the cost for allying the liberals to the idea. But we could enter Greece by force and take Athens to force them to bow to our conditions. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE45.T; The Macedonian attack !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE45.D; The king of Macedonia has refused the reforms of the liberals and is determined to take Greece under its conditions. To face him, the assembly has elected Zimisces king of the Greeks and hope that he can force him out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE46.T; Zimisces Coup d'Etat ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE48.T; Zimisces Rebellion !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE49.T; Zimisces victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE49.D; Macedonia is utterly vainquished and the king has already fled to Aragon. Long live Zimisces !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE50.T;Council of Delphi : Pericles' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE52.D; Seeing that no majority emerged from the Council, Zimisces took action and seized power. He must now face both the anger of the Macedonians and the democrats !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
end_of_exarchate_title; End of the Exarchate Regime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAV1.T; Basque Independence ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV1.D; Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan : The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon. Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using both kingdoms against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French allies to help him. What will happen ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV2.T; A call from Pampelune;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV2.D; The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his independence's inclination. Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead. Henry IV awaits an answer. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV3.T; Independence of Navarre !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV3.D; With the backing of the Anglo-French, Navarre has proclaimed its independence. The Aragonese legate, who was there to ensure the loyalty of the kingdom was expelled along with all Aragonese officials. Henry IV has been acclaimed by the crowds of Pampeluna, however what will be Aragon's reaction ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV4.T; Reaction from Barcelona;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV4.D; Navarre has proclaimed its independence ! They have expelled our representatives with the support of the Dual-Monarchy. We could always intervene militarily and annex this kingdom we have coveted for centuries. But if we do so, we will have to face the Dual-Monarchy ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV5.T; A new ally ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV5.D; Our allies from over the Pyrenees have refused to help us ! Without allies our plan is sure to fail but there is still someone who could help us. The kingdom of Spain would be pleased to help us against Aragon, probably ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV6.T; A call from Pampelune;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV6.D; The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his independence's will. Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead. Henry IV de Bourbon awaits an answer. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV7.T; Proclaimation of Independence !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV7.D; With the backing of the Spanish, Navarre has proclaimed its independence.

athesia_purchase_title; The Athesian Purchase ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
athesia_purchase_desc; The Venitian colony of Athesia is located on a major strategic point. The port of Rialto watches most of ships passing through the Athesian strait and thus controls the traffic going in and out la Baie de Nouvelle-France. Since Venice has been declining lately, it might be the occasion to acquire this territory in exchange of some money ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

habana_purchase_title; The Habanan purchase ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
habana_purchase_desc; With our control over Athesia established, it is time to turn our eyes south. The island of Habana is the only colony that did not join Gran Colombia during the war of independence. It is one of the last Spanish holdings in the New World and it holds a strategic position. To be free from any intervention or disruption of commerce in the Gulf of Mexico, we must control the island. It will require however a large amount of cash and even that will not bind Spain to give Habana...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayiti_purchase_title; The Sudurhafeyjar Purchase ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayiti_purchase_desc; Scandinavia still holds the archipelago they called the Islands of the South consisting of Righavn and Ayiti. Buying these islands would strengthen even more our position in the Caribbean;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

jamaican_purchase_desc; Burgundy still holds the island of Eendrachtsland in the Caribbean. This little island does not present an importance as great as Habana or Ayiti but it would improve our standing in Arcadia even more if we acquired this island. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dissolve_CLM_title; Dissolve the Federation ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
dissolve_CLM_desc; This war has shown us something. The former Spanish colonies united under the same flag are a threat to our influence in Arcadia and Ameriga. Some in our governments has suggested that we make Gran Colombia dissolve itself in little states easier to control and manipulate. Thus there will only be one power in the New-World, us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA1.T;The Anglois Dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA1.D;Ever since the Treaty of Rome in 1498, the Dual Monarchy has had to walk a fine line in not favoring one of its ethnic groups over the others. Recent censi have shown that the English and French represent around one-fifth of the population. What is more threatening to either group is not the other but rather a growing group calling themselves Anglois. These groups have created the dilemma for the monarchy in who to favor. There are those in power that believe that it is best to pick a side while others believe that the Anglois ideology of blending the best customs of English and French is the way of the future. **** NOTE : only French path done yet ****;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA2.T;The Death of King Henri X;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA2.D;Tragedy has struck the Dual Monarchy as His Majesty King Henri X has passed with no heir. Due to traditional laws within the Dual Monarchy, the Estates-General has been called to select their choice for the next ruler of the Kingdom. The Estates have narrowed the selection between Elisabeth, Duchess of Anjou, Edouard, the Duke of York, and Henri, the Duke of Gascony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA3.T;Coronation of Elisabeth I ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA3.D;Despite some opposition votes the Estates-General has declared that Elisabeth will be the next Queen of the Dual Monarchy. Being the daughter of the King's brother gave her the strongest claim to the throne but her pro-Anglois ties has led to some opposition from those in France and England. Both Edouard and Henri have respected the Estates decision and pledged their support to Elisabeth in the future of the Dual Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA4.T;Coronation of Edouard X ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA4.D;It took the Estates-General some rounds of voting but they have settled on Edouard, the Duke of York, as the next King of the Dual Monarchy. England has received the news with great joy while France is worried of potential retribution by the new king for past injustices. Elisabeth and Henri have renounced the throne but Henri vows that he will participate in the Parliament of Lords in preventing bias legislation by the King from being passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA5.T;Coronation of Henri XI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA5.D;To the shock of many Henri, the Duke of Gascony, has been elected the next King of the Dual Monarchy. His election as King has been recieved with joy in the southern regions of the country but outrage has broken out in England. Elisabeth and Edouard has both renounced the throne but Edouard expressed his great displeasure with the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA10.T;The French Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA10.D;After the questions of the last years, the monarchy has affirmed its French character. Rooted in Paris, the monarchy has gained the support of the French population and of its leaders. This French orientation has allowed them to suppress any rebellion in the South but in the same time has alienated them a great part of the English population...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA11.T;The Glorious Revolution ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA11.D;The radicalization of the English society has increased over the past few months. The French turnout of Henri X has alienated him many Englishmen, who were eager to support the monarchy have turned to the liberal hydra. Yesterday the repression of a student manifestation in Cambridge has launched a spiral of violence all over England. It has culminated in the creation of the English Republic which is decided to push “the French out of England”. Apart from some loyalists bastion in Wales and Londres, the revolutionaries are already in control of most the island.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA12.T;St-Louis Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA12.D;The king of the Dual-Monarchy has organised a great ceremony throughout the cities of France to honour his ancestor Louis XI king of France later sanctified as “Saint Louis”. He has put the accent on the treaty of Paris who settled peace between the Plantagenets and the Capetians. In a speech pronounced in the capital by Henri X affirming the French character of the monarchy who always has never forgotten its French roots. While praised on the continent, the speech has been criticized by many in England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA13.T;The great travel of Henri;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA13.D;To further enhance his presence, Henri X decided to travel amongst France. He first visited Normandie where he praised his ancestor Guillaume who embarked to conquer England. He then turned to Brittany, a land attached to the Plantegenian monarchs. His travel led him then to La Rochelle. There he met several of the “Young French” leaders who spontaneously rallied to him and praised his signs in favour of France. He then travelled south passing through Gascony, Toulouse. He then made a stop in Vichy to remember the last great battle against the Valois before returning to the capital. Many people are acclaiming the king for this action that has strengthened the hold of the monarchy in France. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA14.T;The Sons of Harold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA14.D;Lately a wave of contests have risen in England towards the French turn-around of Henri X. The English people have been indeed absent from the speeches of Henri and many are looking to alternatives. A certain John Tolsmith, professor in Cambridge, lately published a monumental history of England before the Norman Conquest. His book has become incredibly popular amongst the English students who have created an association to valorise their “English inheritance” called the “sons of Harold”, in reference to Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king. While this may only be a cultural association, many of its members are prone to radical ideas and it is said that the slogan of “Freiheit, Gleicheit, Brüderlichkeit” are murmured in these circles …  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DUA15.D;The sons of Harold have implemented themselves in this province and are already spreading their ideas ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA16.T;"L'anglais est-il est une langue ?" ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA16.D;A dispute has emerged in the Sorbonne between two scholars to determine if English can be considered as a true language worthy of being spoken in the high spheres such as the government. While it can be seen as just a philological debate, we could influence the result in one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA17.T;A new minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA17.D;Sadly our prime minister has died in office. It falls upon the monarch to choose a new prime minister. Three candidates have the favour of the Parliament : the duke of Richelieu, known for his inclination for the Young French, the duke of Rohan, the Breton moderate and lastly the duke of Devonshire, well-known in the island. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA18.T;The Shakespeare festival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA18.D;The English have organised a festival in Stratford upon Avon to honour a play-writer called William Shakespeare. Rediscovered by the sons of Harold, this unknown author has written many tragicomedies in English, which criticize heavily the Parisian Monarchy while praising English historical figures like his life of Alfred the Great in 4 plays. This festival could become a centre of protestation especially if they represent Henry VI ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA19.T;The death of the Prince of Wales ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA19.D;While visiting England, the Prince of Wales and his entourage were attacked by radicals in the city of Liverpool. It resulted in the death of Henry, the heir of the Dual-Monarchy, his pregnant wife and his son. The attack made with an artisanal weaponry, that many call "the Infernal Machine", was imagined by students affiliated to the Sons of Harold. While Tolsmith has denied any implication of his organisation and vigorously condemned the attack, the king is persuaded of his implication and is determined in his grief to shut the the organisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA27.T;Spread of the Sons of St-Louis ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA27.D;The sons of St-Louis have implemented themselves in this province and are already spreading their ideas ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA40.T;The Anglois dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA40.D;Reconciling both French and English will not be an easy task, Henri X knows it very well. The two groups may not like each other but they hate Paris even more, so an alliance of both needs to be prevented. However one must not charge too much against one group unless one wants a local revolution to happen ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA41.T;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA42.T;Pacification of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA42.D;Despite the peril we managed to win against the revolutionaries, a fact that has strengthened our hold on all our territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA43.T;Independence of England;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA43.D;The English nationalists have secured their independence. We can't succeed in our current policy with them being independent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA44.T;Pacification of the Midi ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA44.D;The Southern parts of our kingdom have been secured ! Despite the rebellion we can continue our policy of accepting both French and English !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA45.T;Independent Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA45.D;The South has escaped from our power. With our mainland territories threatened we can't surely make our rule accepted in both England and France. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA46.T;The Midi Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA47.T;The Franco-English Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA47.D;Revolters have swarmed the streets of the great cities of the Dual-Monarchy in a scale not seen since the First German Revolution ! The nationalist rebels are decided to end the monarchy in blood if necessary and with it the very idea of the Anglois dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA48.T;The Anglo-French monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA48.D;The Plantagenet throne has endured ! Despite the threat of radicals, nationalists and foreign power, all its people stands ready to serve their country ! The coming decades will surely be Anglois for who can stand against the combined force of the Dual-Monarchy of France and England ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA50.T;Choosing a Patron;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA50.D;The King has to choose an historical figure to honor in the coming months. Several proposals have emerged : Alfred the Great, the old Saxon king is admired by many across the Channel, Louis XI the Holy is seen as a benevolent figure here on the continent, Edouard IV was the first Plantagenet born in Paris and thus is seen as both a rallying figure for the Anglois but also a usurper for the French and a traitor for the English. No matter who the King chooses to honour it will not please everyone. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA51.T;Liberal agitations ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA51.D;Liberals and Nationalists from both sides of the Channel have formed societies aimed at spreading their ideas. If we allow them, the Sons of Harold and Saint Louis will surely provoke problems in our territories but banishing them will provoke an even bigger reaction ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA52.T;'Histoire de la France depuis ses origines';;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA52.D;The historian Pierre Guizot has published a new book upon the history of France. The book has received a warm response from French scholars for its exhaustivity. But its portrayal of English and early Plantagenets is quite troublesome and his idea of "a distinct spirit existing since the Gauls' War" only amuses the French nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA53.T;Saxon poetry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA53.D;An anthology of English poetry has been published in Cambridge by the Sons of Harold. Regrouping old and new poets alike, this book has become widely applaused in England but many scholars from Paris consider it a complete waste of time ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA54.T;Travel of the Dauphin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA54.D;Henry X is becoming unfit to travel outside of Paris. He now has to delegate this duty to his son Henry, Dauphin of France and Prince of Wales;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA55.T;A night in theatre ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA55.D;Paris is bursting with cultural creation. Theatres attract the crowds with 3 great pieces having a huge success. First the adaptation of Alfred the Great, the main work of the English author Shakespeare which combines epic and comic, in a way that pleases the Romanticists. Another troup is playing 'Le Malade Imaginaire' of Moliere, a French comic author that travelled the roads of Southern France. Eventually another adaptation of 'Joan the Mad', the tragedy of Racine is still very loved by the court. If one of the Royals would attend one of these spectacles it would surely be seen as a symbol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA56.T;Les Immortels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA56.D;The Rotal Academy was founded in the XVIIth century to host the greatest literary minds of the whole kingdom and it has since evolved to also codify the official language from the monarchy. One of the Immortals' siege has been liberated and we have to nominate someone. Tolsmith despite being a Saxon is recognized as one of the greatest philologists from the kingdom. In Occitania the poet Jasmin has achieved in seducing the minds of the court. But the grammarian Morel could be nominated to show our will of uniformisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA57.T;Celebration of the German Revolution ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA57.D;Radicals in the Kingdom are preparing for the 55th anniversary of the First German Revolution. Some advisors have talked about allowing them to do so to better control them but if we do so then it will cost us our relations with the Bohemian court... Forbidding them to commemorate and organizing great ceremonies remembering the prowess of our armies during the ensuing wars would certainly be a good symbol of unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA58.T;The Rebellions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA58.D;The ongoing 'Springtime of Nations' threaten our efforts of integration !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA59.T;End of the Springtime;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DUA63.T;Conquest of Bourgogne;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA63.D;The duchy of Bourgogne is now completely in our control, a fact that has weakened the French movement !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DUA69.T;Provencal Problems;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA69.D;Tolon is a nest of problems for our state. The kings in-France publish propaganda serving them and give them to agents who easily cross the border. Ending the Provencal state seems the only way to stop this state of affairs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DUA74.D;Yesterday the Dauphin was killed by French nationalists while visiting the city of Orleans ! The explosion also took the lives of his wife, his son and 70 other people. Full of grief the King has enacted several decrees restraining liberties with the assent of the Parliament. The line of succession that was clear is now disputed and the folly of Henry X due to his loss does not ease the situation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DUA90.T;End of the Angevin Legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA90.D;The Great Revolt is over : where the Plantagenets ruled, 4 new nations have arisen. The king has been executed by radicals in Paris and the members from the Royal Family who have survived, escaped to their New World haven of Plantagenia. The overseas territories have been snatched by the other Colonialist Powers and the 4 Sisters Republics of Ireland, England, France and Occitania have pledged to defend each other against the threat of the Counter-revolution. The Anglois dream of multiculturalism is dead and it seems that nationalism may threaten the old European order ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM1.T; The reorganization of Gran Colombia ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLM1.D; Now we have defeated the rebels we have to decide how we shall administer this vast territory. Some are in favor of keeping the Colombians under our rule but it will cost us tremendous amounts of money to successfully rule the area. Most are proposing home rule. Some propose to reestablish the vice-royalties of Lusitania, Mexico and Granada along with the Capitancy-General of Greater Salvador. However we could also dislocate the Granadan territory between a colony around Cartagena, establishing a new Capitancy in Essequibo and giving the rest of Tierra Firme to a Castillian vice-royalty around Caracas. The Andes provinces would be divided between Arequipa and Quito and to avoid a strong Mexico we would separate Jalisco. The choice is the hands of the king. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

And eventually a fringe minority calls for the complete annexation of Lotharingia to form a greater Amerigan Federation.

SS1.T; History of the Dual-Monarchy ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS1.D; The execution of Joan of Arc would come to mark the beginning of the end for the French Wars of Succession (1337-1498), as the Armagnac Party would never again rise to what it once was. The Valois and their allies would fight on for another seventy years, but with the victory of Edward the Red Prince at Vichy the future of a Dual Monarchy of France and England was secured, only being confirmed with the 1498 Treaty of Rome. The threat of encirclement with the Marriage of Anne of Brittany with Jean III of Burgundy, led to the breakdown of the Anglo-Burgundian alliance in 1490 when, unable to challenge the marriage, invaded Brittany during the Anglo-Franco-Breton War (1490-1492). Burgundy, unable to provide support against France due to rebellion fermented by the House of Lorraine, forced Brittany's surrender. While it was too late to annul the marriage, with Jean having consummated it, the Treaty of Le Verger effectively saw Brittany annexed into the French crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS2.T; History of the Dual-Monarchy ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS2.D;The Reformation presented new challenges to the unity of the thrones. The deep involvement of the Valois in aiding Zwingli's escape from Papal and Imperial imprisonment was too good a pretext to end any alternate succession, causing the Languedoc War (1532), and ending with the conquest of Languedoc & Auvergne, leaving only a rump Provencal state in the Azure Coast and in Rhone. In addition to the affairs of Provence, it also engaged in what became known as the Great Game with the Kingdom of Burgundy and the Crown of Aragon. The subject of these wars of influence came about with Navarre (which saw the conquest of the County of Foix & Bearn in 1516), the Italian Peninsula (which ended largely as a victory for the Aragonese, as most of the Peninsula, save Savoy, Genoa, Milan, and the Emilian Dukedoms fell under their influence, compared to only Savoy for the Dual Monarchy), and even the County of Provence (which easily fell into the Aragonese camp to save them from being destroyed by the Plantagenets.);;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS3.T; The History of the Dual-Monarchy ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS3.D;While aggressively fighting heresy abroad the Kings of Both Thrones were initially tolerant of Protestants. King Francois I was torn between dynastic links to the firmly Catholic Jagiellons of Bohemia and a large portion of his populace firm in their new faith. Further strife in England and in Aquitaine combined with the growing threat of Burgundy (long the champion of the Protestant cause) tipped the balance leading first to the Anglo-French Wars of Religion (1598-1614) both within the Kingdom and among its neighbors, and later after the defeat of the Protestants, the Exodus of the Protestant Huguenots to Burgundy, Scandinavia and Colonial New Burgundy (now the Seven Republics) and the Anglican Father Pilgrim and their followers to what they would call New England (now Beornia).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS4.D;While England was briefly a viceroyalty under the Dukes of Gloucester, the throne would be forever undivided following the dissolution of the English Parliament by Henry VII in 1537, and its merging into the Estates General. The nobility with the exception of some distant provinces converged increasingly to Paris as French, became the official language throughout both kingdoms. This led to the gradual Francification of England as once English names were increasingly replaced by French. By the turn of the 19th century, French has become the primary common language in the Southern parts of England. The concept of a centralized Parliamentary body was revolutionary for its time, and, almost ironically, would influence the future legislative bodies of the Burgundian Estates-General, the Savoyard Subalpine Senate, the Aragonese Cortes and the Scandinavian Riksdag, among other European states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS5.D;The Anglo-French history in Ireland was also something of a peculiar moment. During the French Wars of Succession, English, and later Anglo-French control of the Island was left in the hands of the House of Fitzgerald, the Earls of Kildare as much time was spent in building a new administrative apparatus for both England and France. Because of this, the Kildares, along with the House of Desmond, both began to rule Ireland as if it was their own Kingdom. The issues, which had been building up during the twilight years of the reign of Henri VIII culminated in the three Irish Wars (1573-1579, 1583-1594 and the Nine Years’ War, 1598-1607). Which gradually saw Ireland pacified, the rebel Irish Lords killed and the King of England and France reaffirmed as Lord of Ireland. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS6.D;With the unexpected ascension of James IV of Scotland to the Throne of the North in 1500 the Plantagenêts faced the threat of encirclement by the alliance of Burgundy and the former. The exodus of the early 17th century was compounded by wars against Burgundy and Scandinavia pushing emigration to the colonies of Plantagenia and Amazonie. However the pushing towards these colonies were not without strife there as well, as conflicts were rife between Colonial Vinland and New Burgundy, as well as against the Cherokee and Creek, among other First Nation Tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS7.D;Eventually, the Dual Monarchy secured its position as the unquestioned power in Western Europe amid the gradual decline of Spain. A period of relative peace in Europe allowed the Dual Monarchy to expand its influences abroad. The Dual Monarchy established trading posts along the coast of Sierra Lionne, allowed them to trade European goods for slaves to be sent to the New World. A series of wars with the Kingdom of Kandy (1696-1703, 1705-1715, 1716-1717) saw the entirety of Ceylon becoming an Anglo-French crown colony, allowing access to the Indian Ocean Trade through good relations with the Nasirid Sultans of Bengal. At the same time there was a great degree of expansion in the Anglo-French colonies in the New World, as colonial conflicts with Scandinavia, Burgundy and Spain, reinforced its mother country’s position. This period of colonial expansion was broken with the War of the Anglo-French Succession, leading to the independence of Plantagenia under a cadet branch of the House of Plantagenêt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS8.D; Remaining largely aloof during the opening stages of the Great German Wars allowed the industrial revolution to take hold and the Dual Monarchy seemed set to dominate this new realm as well. But the battles of the later war quickly demonstrated that the old rival Burgundy was again on the rise as even beaten and battered it remained victorious, losing only its other colony Amazonie to independence. The Dual Monarchy enters the middle of the 19th century as the ultimate global power, but for the first time in over a century its position does not appear unassailable in Anvers and courts beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM1.T; Administration of Gran Colombia ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM1.D; We have reconquered Gran Colombia but now we have to administrate it. We could keep the rebellious colonies under our direct control but it has proved to be inefficient and one of the causes of the rebellion. We could then allow some home-rule with a direct administrator from Spain to rule over the colonies. The question is then how to divide the area : along the old vice-royalties or on a smaller basis ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLMcusco.T;The question of Cuzco ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLMcusco.D;The old imperial city of the Incan Empire is in our hands since the end of the rebellion. Cuzco has been under our control since 1575 but the area is still predominantly inhabited by Quechua people and few have adopted our customs. Some in our government have suggested to give the territories depending of the Arequipa Capitancy to the Incan Empire to thank them for their intervention during the war. Although they were forced to surrender, the Incans decided the issue of the war by killing the Rebel leader Bolivar. Ceding Cuzco would surely assure us a period of peace in Colombia and ease the tensions that have accumulated over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLM_lib1.T;The end of the rebellion ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLM_lib1.D;The rebels have spread liberal ideas throughout Colombia and many people in our colonies are inclined toward these. Many of the soldiers fighting in the war have heard of them and it seems the liberal hydra will be hard to stop. We can choose to keep absolutism and force the colonies to bow before our representatives. However reconciling with them by allowing them to elect their government under our supervision will be appreciated over the Atlantic but will create dissent here in Spain. Or more simply we could grant a Constitution to both the Colombians and the Spanish peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Victim of fierce fightings between Loyalists and Independentists, the city was shelled by the Spanish navy in 1819 and never fully recovered. However many of the landowners of the area are trusting the monarchy to rebuild the city and they have made a gracious donation to help vanquish the rebels.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Already, crowds are gathering in Nova Lisboa and San Salvador to blame the Mexican government and the so-proclaimed president Miranda for the defeat. What will happen to the Federation ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM17.T;Administration of Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM17.D;The treaty of Cartagena has left us with many possibilities in Ameriga. We could maintain the old order but at the cost of increased rebellions or allow home-rule.

CLM18.D;With the signature of the peace of Cartagena, the hold of Mexico over the Federation has loosened. Both Lusitanian and Mesoamericans are asking for a congress to be held in Mexico to decide of the future of the federation. However many generals fear the outcome of this session and partisans of the war hero Santa Anna want him to take command. Such a move would however only increase the various independentists movements... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM23.D;The Federation has lived but even Mexico is crumbling under the independists demands. Determined to get their independence, the Lusitanian and Mesoamerigan representatives have turned the natives against the old government, each asking a country on their own. The military has now retired to Jalisco, the only province they have managed to retain ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM24.T;The Veracruz Plan ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM24.D;Maintaining Order in Gran Colombia has been hard since the accession of Santa Anna to Presidency. Liberals are criticizing "the extraordinary measures" took by Santa Anna and some already think that Spanish domination would be softer than the one imposed by the Mexican miltary. To help fight the secessionist movements in Lusitania and Mesoamerica, Santa Anna has met in Veracruz with Inacio Madeira and José Morazan. The first is a Lusitanian war hero who has led the recapture of Nova Lisboa in the last moments of the war and thus acquired a prestigious figure in Lusitania. The second is the symbol of assimilation of the Native populations, his family indeed originates from Mayan caciques who then became great figures in San Salvador. A leader of the independence war, he is revered by both Mayan and Mesoamerigan populations. Along with these two prominent figures, Santa Anna has designed a plan which divides the country into three spheres of influence until the Federation is ready to fight once more the Spanish.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM25.T;The Monclova Fort ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM25.D;Tension have erupted in Tejas since the Veracruz Plan. Madeira has always refused to accept Mexican claims on the territories that belonged to the vice-royalty of Lusitania.

CHI1.D; The Spanish who control the island of Hainan have approached us to negotiate a treaty of friendship and assistance between the Catholic king and our leader.

HRE9.T;The Prague Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE9.D;After having reaffirmed his hegemony over the various principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, the emperor, Sigismund V has issued a Proclamation destined to all the members of the Imperial Diet. Determined to pursue the reforms of centralization advocated by his father Wenceslaus VIII during the German Wars, the emperor asks all the princes of the empires to join in a single state from the Danube to the Elbe. Should the Empire be centralized it would mean an upheaval of the balance of powers on the continent but nothing is set in stone for now. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE10.T;The Reactions towards the Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE10.D;The Proclamation has had various results throughout the Empire. Already all the good princes have joined the Reich !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE11.T;The Prague Proclamation : Success  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE11.D;The majority of the princes and free cities of the Empire have accepted the Proclamation. The discordant voices are alone amongst this common sentiment. The Emperor is really now the king of the Germans and to give them guarantees he already moved his court to Frankfurt am Main where all the institutions will be centralized. However this move has angered the Bohemians who don’t accept to be the heart of the Empire and the idea of secession is brewing in the mind of some.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE12.T;The Prague Proclamation : Complete Failure  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE12.D;Instead of achieving a centralized empire the Proclamation launched the contrary move. All German princes ahve united and are marching toward Prague ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE13.T;Local Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE13.D;We unite to push back the Bohemians !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HRE20.T;Prague Proclamation : Mixed results ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HRE20.D;The princes of the Empire did not go much in favour or against the centralisation and most are pushing for negotiations. We'll see that in each region;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HRE50.T;Bohemian nationalism ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE50.D;"Lion over Eagle!" "We are no Germans!" "Down with the traitor!" These and many more shouts can be heard almost everyday in Prague, Pilsen, Brünn,...The Bohemian people feel betrayed by the recent development in the realm and they fear that their privileged position they have been enjoying as citizens of the Imperial heartland for centuries is waning. Is it a sign of things to come ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE51.T;Bohemian riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE51.D;It started as a meaningless brawl. One drunk Bohemian anti-Imperialist was loudly swearing and a nearby walking police officer tried to calm him down, only to be punched to the face. When the officer tried to defend himself, the drunk pulled a knife, the policeman panicked and shot him in the chest. Other Bohemians seeing that promptly killed the officer, stormed a close weapons depot and started building a barricade in one of the city's streets. Looks like trouble is brewing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE54.T;The Bohemian Revolution !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE54.D;"To arms! To arms! For our freedom and our pride! Down with the German tyranny!" After a series of incidents following the unification of the Holy Roman Empire and the subsequent centralisation acts, the situation in Bohemia escalated in a full-blown crisis. Bohemian aristocrats formed a national assembly and declared the Bohemian Crown Lands independent from the rest of the Empire. Disgruntled Bohemians, joined by many veteran soldiers of Holy Roman armies are already flocking to their ranks, gearing for war. Is peace in central Europe really a dream impossible to come true? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE55.T;Intervention in Mitteleuropa ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE55.D;With the Bohemians rebelling, we have a chance to cripple the Kaiserreich. For glory ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE56.T;Independence ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE56.D;At last we have succeeded. The war cost us many lives but we have secured our homeland from the traitor Kaiser ! Let it be known that Bohemia will never bow again before the Germans ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE57.T;Bohemian Mobilisation ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE57.D;Now it is obvious that the war between the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia will be fought on a scale never seen before. The Bohemian citizens are en masse joining the Free Corps and donating their belongings to the war effort. The story of a girl who, having no other property or money, donated a lock of her hair is just one of the many. The Bohemian lion is now standing tall, ready to take on his enemies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE58.T;Prague is lost ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE58.D;Ein Reich, ein Deutschland. That's easier to say than to fulfil. The Bohemians decided not to be just regular members of the Holy Roman Empire and somehow managed to defeat our newborn country, striking a deep wound into its flesh. With the blue-red-white tricolour flying over the Prague Castle, they have lost the chance to be full citizens of the Empire. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE59.T;The Revolution was crushed ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE59.D;Ein Reich, ein Deutschland. Only fools would want to stand against the wind of destiny. The foolish Bohemians have tried to do just that and paid the price of blood for it. But our Empire has bled, too, and so it is important that the peace shall now rule in Mitteleuropa for eternity. And thanks only to our glorious nation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE60.T;The new Constitution ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CRO7.D;Before the Civil War, Montenegro was divided in various principalites.

CRO8.D;The Illyrian have allowed the claimant to the dukedom of Montenegro, Jospeh Simic to sneak into Kotor where he actually tries to convince people to join our heretic neighbour.
