reclaim_occitania_desc;Even now that we are king of Italy we can't forget our claims in France. Our state is the reunion of many cultures, the French and Occitan having the same rights than the Italians we have united. We can't establish a Dual-Monarchy of France-Italy for now but we could claim the Mediterranean provinces of the usurpers. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
venetians_culture_title;Integration of the Venetians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x       
venetians_culture_desc;The people under the government of the Serenissima have distinguished themselves from their Italians brothers because of their ties with the East. But now that Venice is in the hands of the Italian Nation, it is our duty to fully integrate them into our national fabric;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
dominium_maris_baltici_title; Dominium Maris Baltici;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
dominium_maris_baltici_desc; The greatest aspiration of the Kalmar Union has always been the complete control of the Baltic Sea. While the Scandinavians gained several holdings in the region, they still miss Prussia and the Lithuanian coast. Let us claim these areas for the glory of the Union !  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

kurland_annexation_desc; The last obstacle to our complete domination of the Baltic sea is the small state of Kourland. For too long, we have let them pursue a semi-independent policy and it is now time to reclaim their full integration in the kingdom ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

treaty_of_Corfu_desc;The Doge has been unable to take back the mainland. The war which erupted a while ago is drawing on its end and we are winning ! Aragon and Bohemia have offered to mediate in our advantage the signature of a treaty which will push Venice out of Hellas. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
222120.T; Flight to Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
222120.D; The defeat is total for the Venetians. They have been pushed away from their homeland by the Italian nationalists. But they still hold many holdings in the East, where their government fled. Upon entering the city of Athens, the Doge was forced by the Greeks to proclaim an Hellenic Republic while still holding his old title. A new state has emerged from the ashes of the Serenessima, what will it become ?  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
ENL5.T;A Savoyard opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL5.D;For a long time we have coveted the Alpine passes held by the Duke of Savoy. The Dual-Monarchy faces open rebellion and is thus less inclined to protect the Duke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL6.T;Ultimatum from Antwerp;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL6.D;Burgundy asks us to relinquish our Alpine lands to integrate them into 'the Duchy of Geneva'. With the Dual-Monarchy facing harsh unrest we should not count too much on their protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL7.T;Savoyard Answer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL7.D;The duke of Savoy has refused, meaning that only war will resolve the problem of the Alpes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL1.T;The restoration of order in Etruria ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL1.D;The republic of Etruria is the threat to the Italian Order. While Aragon is reluctant to go to war against them, we haven't forgotten our right to the grand duchy of Tuscany. The various monarchs of North Italy would not react to this declaration because we would erase a threat to their personal power but Aragon would be angered by our demonstration of force. What do we choose ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
lucca_war_title;Pre-eminence in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
lucca_war_desc;The liberal republic of Etruria has been reduced to ashes with the King in France reclaiming his inheritance of Tuscany. But the duchy of Lucca has not accepted our renewed role in the area, proclaiming being freed from any feudal links toward us. While it is an obscure claim, we could always press it to strengthen our rule in Italy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL3.T;The Provencal Demands ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL3.D;The grand-duke of Tuscany and king of France has threatened us to press his rightful claim to our duchy if we do not bow to him. Many people in Italy would be eager to help us if the Valois would invade our duchy and a new anti-Valois league is slowly forming. Perhaps we are strong enough to force them to fall back ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL4.T;The Luccan league;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL4.D;We have been contacted by the duke of Lucca who has been threatened at multiple times by the king in France. He asks us to join a league against the Valois and free Tuscany from their hands if they dared take any action against the duchy. What do we do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL5.T;The Luccan league;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL5.D;The Valois have taken back Florence. Threatened by the renewed threat in the region, Lucca has asked us to back them against the ambitions of the kings in France. What do we do ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL6.T;The Luccan league;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL6.D;We have been contacted by the duke of Lucca who has been threatened at multiple times by the king in France. He asks us to join a league against the Valois and free Tuscany from their hands if they dared take any action against the duchy. What do we do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL7.T;Response from Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL7.D;The duke of Lucca has refused to bow to our demands. Moreover he has apparently received the support of the various Italian principalites against us. We could take the chances and froce all Italians to bow before us but it would be a long and difficult war or we can still fall back our claims;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL8.T;Response from Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL8.D;The duke of Lucca has bowed to our demands. We are now in control of Lucca in all but name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL9.T;The Valois attack ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL9.D;The Provencal have attacked our ally in Lucca. It is now our duty to take part in the oncoming war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL10.T;The Valois attack ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VAL11.D;Now that Florence is free we will make peace with the Valois;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL12.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL12.D;A new war has erupted in Italy. Having regained Tuscany, the king in France has tried to extend his influence throughout the Italian states. But the Italian princes have now allied against him, and their armies are trying to push him out of Italy. This war puts the dream of a Valois kingdom of Italy at great risk, however if the Valois ever win this war, it could mark the birth of a new power in Southern Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL13.T;The Italian crown ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL13.D;Merging the Italian and Aragon crowns has been our goals for centuries. The pesky kings in France have claimed the Italian crown and are stirring the South Italian to revolt. We can't allow it. If we ever want to remain a great power then we must annex this upstart state in the North ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL14.T;The Italian war of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL14.D;The king of Aragon has refused to acknowledge our right to the Italian Crown. They have issued a declaration of war against us to "take what is theirs". This war will define the very future of Italy. Will the Valois succeed or will the crown of Aragon emerge victorious ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL15.T;Savoyard Intervention ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL15.D;We have stayed out the Italian war until now, but it is now our duty to free Tuscany. The duke of Lucca has fled to our court begging our support in the war which he has lost for now ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL16.T;Savoy enters the arena;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL16.D;The duke of Savoy, angered by the reunion of Lucca to our duchy has entered the Italian war, promising to make us leave Italy forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL17.T;The end of the Valois  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL17.D;Provence has lived long enough. At least it's what the Dual-Monarchy thinks. Diplomatically isolated since the decaying of Aragon, this little state which still defies the Plantagenet will be crushed. For St-Denis and St-Georges, let us end the Hundred Years War forever ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE1.T;Greek Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE1.D;Venice's hold of Greece has been tedious since the beginning of the occupation during the Ottoman collapse. With the liberal movement gaining weight at home, the Greek nationalists have become more audacious over time. They reclaim an assembly of all Greeks to decide their future in the Republic. If this council is not held, this could lead to the rise of a rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE2.T;Opening of the Council of Athens ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE2.D;The Greek council finally opens in Athens, the magnificent city of Ancient Greece. Three great factions have formed over the previous months : the Zimisceses, followers of the general who helped Venice "protect" Greece 20 years ago, who want to establish an independent Greek state, the Exarchates, who want to acquire more autonomy, and the Pireans or "Italians", loyalists of Venice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE3.T;The result of the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE3.D;It is finally the end of the Council, what will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE4.T;The Council of Athens : Zimisceses' victory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE4.D;The Zimisceses have won the majority of the votes during the Council. Zimisces has profited from the occasion to declare the independence of Greece, and has rallied most of the Greek soldiers around him ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE5.T;The Council of Athens : Exarchates' victory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE5.D;The Exarchates have won the majority of the votes during the Council. They now ask for autonomy under the protection of Venice. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
GRE6.T;Failure of the Exarchates' proposition ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE6.D;Venice refusing Home Rule for the Greeks has led the Exarchates to rally with the Zimisceses and to proclaim the independence of Greece. Most of continental Greece is already in their control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE7.T;The Council of Athens : Pireans' Victory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE7.D;Unexpectedly, the Venetians loyalists won the majority of the vote during the Council. They are ready to stay under the government of Venice but only if Venice reforms itself and give the same political rights to Greeks as the Italians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE8.T;Pireans failure ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE8.D;Venice has refused the chart proposed by the Loyalists. It has discredited them and most of the Greek representatives have rallied around Zimisces. Nearly all of continental Greece is now under their control ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE9.T;Council of Athens : No majority ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE9.D;No majority has emerged from the Council. Angered by the indecision of the politicians, the Greek general and war hero Zimisces has rallied his supportes in Thessalia and Attica and is determined to deliver Greece from the Italian oppressors. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE10.T;Fight for Freedom !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE17.D;The Cypriots have proclaimed the island of Cyprus to be a full part of Greece !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE18.T;The treaty of Corfu ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE18.D;The war with Greece has been lost. Guaranteed by Aragon and Bohemia, Zimisces has forces the signature of an humiliating treaty on the island of Corfu. Greece will be independent and Venice will free the territories under its control and relinquish any claims on Greek territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE19.T;The Constitution ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE19.D;Greece has won its independence by the treaty of Corfu, but now a new problem arises. Zimisces has had all powers during the revolution but not everybody is ready to agree with it. A new Greek council has been called in Delphi to settle the question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE20.T;Greek Rebellion Crushed ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE20.D;Venice has reclaimed all rebels' territory ! Zimisces has been arrested and executed in the city of Athens. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE23.T;End of the war. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE23.D;Greece has won its independence. It is now the time to unite with them ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE24.T;Crete joins Greece ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE29.T;A new council ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE29.D;Greece has won its independence, but now a new problem arises. Zimisces has had all powers during the revolution but not everybody is ready to agree with it. A new Greek council has been called in Delphi to settle the question ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE30.T;Zimisces' rebels ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE30.D;After the interdiction of the council of Athens, Greek nationalists have radicalized. They founded the secret society of Filiki Eteria and recruited new members all over the Greek territory. They rose led by the general and war hero Zimisces who has proclaimed the independence of a new Greek state !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE31.T;Pireans' Victory ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE31.D;Cyprus has chosen to stay under Venice dominion ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE40.T;Opening of the Delphi Council  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE40.D;A new council is held in Greece. This time, the Greek representatives have assembled to discuss the draft of a constitution and there are already different factions opposing each other. First the Zimisceses, who defend a strong monarchy under Zimisces, the war hero and current leader of the state. There is also the Alexandros faction, who support the election of the king of Macedonia to the Greek throne but with more restrictions on the power of monarch. Finally the Pericles faction which wants to institute a real Republic. No matter what the result will be, the shadow of Zimisces is always present and he could try to take power for himself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE41.T;Opening of the Delphi Council ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE41.D;It is the end of the Delphi Council ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE42.T;Delphi Council : Zimisceses resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE42.D;The Greek representatives have decided to give the power to the current leader Konstantinos Zimisces, who will be crowned king of the Hellens. An assembly will be called, and political liberties are guaranteed but the king retains much of the power ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE43.T;Delphi Council : Alexandros resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE43.D;The Greek representatives have chosen to unite with Macedonia. But it will be at the coast of many political reforms asked by the liberals. Moreover Zimisces seems to be ready to launch a coup to claim power. What will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE44.T;The crown of Greece ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE44.D;The Supporters of the Macedonian king have succeeded during the council of Athens. But they are saying that in exchange of the crown, the monarch will have to rescind its power and give a democratic assembly to the people and stop the multicultural policy started in Macedonia. That's the cost for allying the liberals to the idea. But we could enter Greece by force and take Athens to force them to bow to our conditions. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE45.T;The Macedonian attack !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE45.D;The king of Macedonia has refused the reforms of the liberals and is determined to take Greece under its conditions. To face him, the assembly has elected Zimisces king of the Greeks and hope that he can force him out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE46.T;Zimisces Coup d'Etat ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE46.D;Zimisces has seized the power despite the choice of our king in the council. We must march on Athens and take what is ours from this upstart general !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE47.D;We have taken the city of Athens and captured Zimisces. He has been promptly executed and the Greek government has proclaimed the end of the war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE48.T;Zimisces Rebellion !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE48.D;Since the union of Greece and Macedonia, Zimisces has been plotting against the new monarch hoping to seize power in its place. Large tracts of Greece have risen in favor of Zimisces. We must crush him !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE49.T;Zimisces victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE49.D;Macedonia is utterly vainquished and the king has already fled to Aragon. Long live Zimisces !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE50.T;Council of Delphi : Pericles' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE50.D; The Council of Delphi has led to the establishment of a new Hellen Democracy. Let us hope that the Republic will bring us to glory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE51.T;Coup d'Etat !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE51.D;Zimisces has been plotting since the establishment of the Republic to gain power. Today he has entered Athens and asked the military to help him end the political squabbles. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE52.T;Council of Delphi : Zimisces Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE52.D;Seeing that no majority emerged from the Council, Zimisces took action and seized power. He must now face both the anger of the Macedonians and the democrats !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAV1.T;Basque Independence ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV1.D;Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan : The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon. Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using both kingdoms against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French allies to help him. What will happen ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV2.T;A call from Pampelune;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV2.D;The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his independence's inclination. Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead. Henry IV awaits an answer. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAV4.T;Reaction from Barcelona;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV4.D;Navarre has proclaimed its independence ! They have expelled our representatives with the support of the Dual-Monarchy. We could always intervene militarily and annex this kingdom we have coveted for centuries. But if we do so, we will have to face the Dual-Monarchy ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV5.T;A new ally ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAV10.D;The Bourbon dynasty has seen fewer and fewer male members born these last years. The last true Bourbon, descendant of Hugh Capet has died in Pampeluna yesterday. He leaves two possible heirs : his sister the countess of St-Sebastian married into the Aragonese family and the infante of Bilbao his illegimate daughter married to the Dauphin. The Navarran Estates have gathered to choose who will succeed to Henry and thus in which country Navarra will be tied with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAV13.D;The king of Aragon has decided to push the claims of the countess of St-Sebastian to the throne of Navarra. Even if it just concerns Navarra, we should send an ultimatum to Aragon demanding them to back down and acknowledge the infante as the rightful queen !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

athesia_purchase_desc; The Venetian colony of Athesia is located on a major strategic point. The port of Rialto watches most of ships passing through the Athesian strait and thus controls the traffic going in and out la Baie de Nouvelle-France. Since Venice has been declining lately, it might be the occasion to acquire this territory in exchange of some money ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

habana_purchase_title; The Habanan purchase ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
habana_purchase_desc; With our control over Athesia established, it is time to turn our eyes south. The island of Habana is the only colony that did not join Gran Colombia during the war of independence. It is one of the last Spanish holdings in the New World and it holds a strategic position. To be free from any intervention or disruption of commerce in the Gulf of Mexico, we must control the island. It will require however a large amount of cash and even that will not bind Spain to give Habana...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dissolve_CLM_desc;This war has shown us something. The former Spanish colonies united under the same flag are a threat to our influence in Arcadia and Ameriga.

Thus there will only be one power in the New-World, us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA1.T;The Anglois Dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA1.D;Ever since the Treaty of Rome in 1498, the Dual Monarchy has had to walk a fine line in not favouring one of its ethnic groups over the others. Recent censi have shown that the English and French represent around one-fifth of the population. What is more threatening to either group is not the other but rather a growing group calling themselves Anglois. These groups have created the dilemma for the monarchy in who to favor. There are those in power that believe that it is best to pick a side while others believe that the Anglois ideology of blending the best customs of English and French is the way of the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA2.T;The Death of King Henri X;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA2.D;Tragedy has struck the Dual Monarchy as His Majesty King Henri X has passed with no heir. Due to traditional laws within the Dual Monarchy, the Estates-General has been called to select their choice for the next ruler of the Kingdom. The Estates have narrowed the selection between Elisabeth, Duchess of Anjou, Edouard, the Duke of York, and Henri, the Duke of Gascony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA3.T;Coronation of Elisabeth I ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA3.D;Despite some opposition votes the Estates-General has declared that Elisabeth will be the next Queen of the Dual Monarchy. Being the daughter of the King's brother gave her the strongest claim to the throne but her pro-Anglois ties has led to some opposition from those in France and England. Both Edouard and Henri have respected the Estates decision and pledged their support to Elisabeth in the future of the Dual Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA4.T;Coronation of Edouard X ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA4.D;It took the Estates-General some rounds of voting but they have settled on Edouard, the Duke of York, as the next King of the Dual Monarchy. England has received the news with great joy while France is worried of potential retribution by the new king for past injustices. Elisabeth and Henri have renounced the throne but Henri vows that he will participate in the Parliament of Lords in preventing bias legislation by the King from being passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA5.T;Coronation of Henri XI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA5.D;To the shock of many Henri, the Duke of Gascony, has been elected the next King of the Dual Monarchy. His election as King has been recieved with joy in the southern regions of the country but outrage has broken out in England. Elisabeth and Edouard has both renounced the throne but Edouard expressed his great displeasure with the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We need to contact a Great Power to counter the threat from Paris : Scandinavia has a good navy and shares a border in Scotland ; Burgundy will surely dominate on the Continent, Aragon can easily pierce through Occitania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA8.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA8.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have revolted against the Dual-Monarchy and are asking to protect them from the Anglois. Such a move will lead to war against Paris but it is a golden opportunity to weaken the Plantagenets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA9.T;A new Hastings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA9.D;The English will face our might !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA10.T;The French Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA10.D;After the questions of the last years, the monarchy has affirmed its French character. Rooted in Paris, the monarchy has gained the support of the French population and of its leaders. This French orientation has allowed them to suppress any rebellion in the South but in the same time has alienated them a great part of the English population...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA11.T;The Glorious Revolution ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA11.D;The radicalization of the English society has increased over the past few months. The French turnout of Henri X has alienated him many Englishmen, who were eager to support the monarchy have turned to the liberal hydra. Yesterday the repression of a student manifestation in Cambridge has launched a spiral of violence all over England. It has culminated in the creation of the English Republic which is decided to push “the French out of England”. Apart from some loyalists bastion in Wales and Londres, the revolutionaries are already in control of most the island.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA12.T;St-Louis Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA12.D;The king of the Dual-Monarchy has organised a great ceremony throughout the cities of France to honour his ancestor Louis XI king of France later sanctified as “Saint Louis”. He has put the accent on the treaty of Paris who settled peace between the Plantagenets and the Capetians. In a speech pronounced in the capital by Henri X affirming the French character of the monarchy who always has never forgotten its French roots. While praised on the continent, the speech has been criticized by many in England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA13.T;The great travel of Henri;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA13.D;To further enhance his presence, Henri X decided to travel amongst France. He first visited Normandie where he praised his ancestor Guillaume who embarked to conquer England. He then turned to Brittany, a land attached to the Plantegenian monarchs. His travel led him then to La Rochelle. There he met several of the “Young French” leaders who spontaneously rallied to him and praised his signs in favour of France. He then travelled south passing through Gascony, Toulouse. He then made a stop in Vichy to remember the last great battle against the Valois before returning to the capital. Many people are acclaiming the king for this action that has strengthened the hold of the monarchy in France. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA14.T;The Sons of Harold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA14.D;Lately a wave of contests have risen in England towards the French turn-around of Henri X. The English people have been indeed absent from the speeches of Henri and many are looking to alternatives. A certain John Tolsmith, professor in Cambridge, lately published a monumental history of England before the Norman Conquest. His book has become incredibly popular amongst the English students who have created an association to valorise their “English inheritance” called the “sons of Harold”, in reference to Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king. While this may only be a cultural association, many of its members are prone to radical ideas and it is said that the slogan of “Freiheit, Gleicheit, Brüderlichkeit” are murmured in these circles …  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA15.T;Spread of the Sons of Harold ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA15.D;The sons of Harold have implemented themselves in this province and are already spreading their ideas ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA16.T;"L'anglais est-il est une langue ?" ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA16.D;A dispute has emerged in the Sorbonne between two scholars to determine if English can be considered as a true language worthy of being spoken in the high spheres such as the government. While it can be seen as just a philological debate, we could influence the result in one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA17.T;A new minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA17.D;Sadly our prime minister has died in office. It falls upon the monarch to choose a new prime minister. Three candidates have the favour of the Parliament : the duke of Richelieu, known for his inclination for the Young French, the duke of Rohan, the Breton moderate and lastly the duke of Devonshire, well-known in the island. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA18.T;The Shakespeare festival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA18.D;The English have organised a festival in Stratford upon Avon to honour a play-writer called William Shakespeare. Rediscovered by the sons of Harold, this unknown author has written many tragicomedies in English, which criticize heavily the Parisian Monarchy while praising English historical figures like his life of Alfred the Great in 4 plays. This festival could become a centre of protestation especially if they represent Henry VI ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA19.T;The death of the Prince of Wales;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA19.D;While visiting England, the Prince of Wales and his entourage were attacked by radicals in the city of Liverpool. It resulted in the death of Henry, the heir of the Dual-Monarchy, his pregnant wife and his son. The attack made with an artisanal weaponry, that many call "the Infernal Machine", was imagined by students affiliated to the Sons of Harold. While Tolsmith has denied any implication of his organisation and vigorously condemned the attack, the king is persuaded of his implication and is determined in his grief to shut the the organisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA21.T;The English Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA21.D;Despite the troubles of the past years the monarchy has asserted its English roots. With London and Paris weighing the same in political matters the monarchy has gained the support of the English population!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA22.T;The Midi Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA22.D;The English backlash of Henry X has alienated the Southern French lands. The local Occitans have always been more rebellious because of their protestant roots and also because of their support for the Valois kings. The Revolt supported by the Sons of St-Louis has gained the control of most Occitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA23.T;Choosing the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA23.D;The Occitan state must now choose what form of government it shall be : will they welcome the Valois pretender or proclaim a free Republic ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA24.T;The March on Toulouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA24.D;The rebellious Occitan have acknowledged the Valois as the true Kings of France and pledged their loyalty to the reconquest of the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA25.T;The new Hundred Years War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA25.D;Provence has taken control of our rebellious provinces and has pledged to not stop until Paris! We can't let them do this and must put an end to the War for the French Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA26.T;The Counter-revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA26.D;Occitania has affirmed as an independent Republic! We can't let them do such a thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA27.T;Creation of the Sons of St-Louis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA27.D;A french nationalist organisation has been created yesterday in La Rochelle by a certain Francois Guizot, a university historian. The aim of this association is to strengthen the conscience of the French and Provencal people and make them aware of their distinctness from the British. The name has been taken from Louis XI, a King who was later canonized and who he is seen as a fatherly figure of French history. It is particularly popular amongst the French students and many fear they might be spreading revolutionary ideals...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA28.T;Spread of the Sons of St-Louis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA28.D;The sons of St-Louis have implemented themselves in this province and are already spreading their ideas ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA29.T;The Great Royal Travel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA29.D;To further enhance his presence, Henri X decided to travel amongst England. He first landed near Hastings where he praised his ancestor Guillaume who there managed to win the English crown. He then went to Londres where he visited the locals of the East Indian Company on the boards of the Tamise. His travel led him then to Cambridge and Ofxord. There he met several of the “Young English” leaders who spontaneously rallied to him and praised his signs in favour of England. He then travelled west and north passing through Wales and Livreport. He then made a stop in York to praise Richard Plantagenet, duke of York, one of the heroes of the early Dual-Monarchy. Many people are acclaiming the king for this action that has strengthened the hold of the monarchy in England. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA30.T;Romanticism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA30.D;A new school has appeared in arts. The Romanticists defy the laws established by the classical school of Paris and coming back to the roots of Baroque. It is especially successful in England. Tolsmith and Lord Byron are publishing poems taking their roots in the old Saxon mythology, Scnery is writing plays who are inspired by Shakespeare... This school has however little sucess amongst the literary critics of the capital who accuse them of recklessly crossing laws that were fixed by wise Elders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA40.T;The Anglois dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA40.D;Reconciling both French and English will not be an easy task, Henri X knows it very well. The two groups may not like each other but they hate Paris even more, so an alliance of both needs to be prevented. However one must not charge too much against one group unless one wants a local revolution to happen ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA41.T;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA42.T;Pacification of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA42.D;Despite the peril we managed to win against the revolutionaries, a fact that has strengthened our hold on all our territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA43.T;Independence of England;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA43.D;The English nationalists have secured their independence. We can't succeed in our current policy with them being independent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA44.T;Pacification of the Midi ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA44.D;The Southern parts of our kingdom have been secured ! Despite the rebellion we can continue our policy of accepting both French and English !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA45.T;Independent Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA45.D;The South has escaped from our power. With our mainland territories threatened we can't surely make our rule accepted in both England and France. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA46.T;The Midi Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA47.T;The Franco-English Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA47.D;Revolters have swarmed the streets of the great cities of the Dual-Monarchy in a scale not seen since the First German Revolution ! The nationalist rebels are decided to end the monarchy in blood if necessary and with it the very idea of the Anglois dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA48.T;The Anglo-French monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA48.D;The Plantagenet throne has endured ! Despite the threat of radicals, nationalists and foreign power, all its people stands ready to serve their country ! The coming decades will surely be Anglois for who can stand against the combined force of the Dual-Monarchy of France and England ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA50.T;Choosing a Patron;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA50.D;The King has to choose an historical figure to honor in the coming months. Several proposals have emerged : Alfred the Great, the old Saxon king is admired by many across the Channel, Louis XI the Holy is seen as a benevolent figure here on the continent, Edouard IV was the first Plantagenet born in Paris and thus is seen as both a rallying figure for the Anglois but also a usurper for the French and a traitor for the English. No matter who the King chooses to honour it will not please everyone. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA51.T;Liberal agitations ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA51.D;Liberals and Nationalists from both sides of the Channel have formed societies aimed at spreading their ideas. If we allow them, the Sons of Harold and Saint Louis will surely provoke problems in our territories but banishing them will provoke an even bigger reaction ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA52.T;'Histoire de la France depuis ses origines';;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA52.D;The historian Pierre Guizot has published a new book upon the history of France. The book has received a warm response from French scholars for its exhaustivity. But its portrayal of English and early Plantagenets is quite troublesome and his idea of "a distinct spirit existing since the Gauls' War" only amuses the French nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA53.T;Saxon poetry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA53.D;An anthology of English poetry has been published in Cambridge by the Sons of Harold. Regrouping old and new poets alike, this book has become widely applaused in England but many scholars from Paris consider it a complete waste of time ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA54.T;Travel of the Dauphin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA54.D;Henry X is becoming unfit to travel outside of Paris. He now has to delegate this duty to his son Henry, Dauphin of France and Prince of Wales;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA55.T;A night in theatre ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA55.D;Paris is bursting with cultural creation. Theatres attract the crowds with 3 great pieces having a huge success. First the adaptation of Alfred the Great, the main work of the English author Shakespeare which combines epic and comic, in a way that pleases the Romanticists. Another troup is playing 'Le Malade Imaginaire' of Moliere, a French comic author that travelled the roads of Southern France. Eventually another adaptation of 'Joan the Mad', the tragedy of Racine is still very loved by the court. If one of the Royals would attend one of these spectacles it would surely be seen as a symbol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA56.T;Les Immortels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA56.D;The Rotal Academy was founded in the XVIIth century to host the greatest literary minds of the whole kingdom and it has since evolved to also codify the official language from the monarchy. One of the Immortals' siege has been liberated and we have to nominate someone. Tolsmith despite being a Saxon is recognized as one of the greatest philologists from the kingdom. In Occitania the poet Jasmin has achieved in seducing the minds of the court. But the grammarian Morel could be nominated to show our will of uniformisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA57.T;Celebration of the German Revolution ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA57.D;Radicals in the Kingdom are preparing for the 55th anniversary of the First German Revolution. Some advisors have talked about allowing them to do so to better control them but if we do so then it will cost us our relations with the Bohemian court... Forbidding them to commemorate and organizing great ceremonies remembering the prowess of our armies during the ensuing wars would certainly be a good symbol of unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA58.T;The Rebellions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DUA90.D;The Great Revolt is over : where the Plantagenets ruled, 4 new nations have arisen. The king has been executed by radicals in Paris and the members from the Royal Family who have survived, escaped to their New World haven of Plantagenia. The overseas territories have been snatched by the other Colonialist Powers and the 4 Sisters Republics of Ireland, England, France and Occitania have pledged to defend each other against the threat of the Counter-revolution. The Anglois dream of multiculturalism is dead and it seems that nationalism may threaten the old European order ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM1.D; Now we have defeated the rebels we have to decide how we shall administer this vast territory. Some are in favor of keeping the Colombians under our rule but it will cost us tremendous amounts of money to successfully rule the area. Most are proposing home rule. Some propose to reestablish the vice-royalties of Lusitania, Mexico and Granada along with the Capitancy-General of Greater Salvador. However we could also dislocate the Granadan territory between a colony around Cartagena, establishing a new Capitancy in Essequibo and giving the rest of Tierra Firme to a Castillian vice-royalty around Caracas. The Andes provinces would be divided between Arequipa and Quito and to avoid a strong Mexico we would separate Jalisco. The choice is the hands of the king. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

And eventually a fringe minority calls for the complete annexation of Lotharingia to form a greater Amerigan Federation.

SS1.T; History of the Dual-Monarchy ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS1.D; The execution of Joan of Arc would come to mark the beginning of the end for the French Wars of Succession (1337-1498), as the Armagnac Party would never again rise to what it once was. The Valois and their allies would fight on for another seventy years, but with the victory of Edward the Red Prince at Vichy the future of a Dual Monarchy of France and England was secured, only being confirmed with the 1498 Treaty of Rome. The threat of encirclement with the Marriage of Anne of Brittany with Jean III of Burgundy, led to the breakdown of the Anglo-Burgundian alliance in 1490 when, unable to challenge the marriage, invaded Brittany during the Anglo-Franco-Breton War (1490-1492). Burgundy, unable to provide support against France due to rebellion fermented by the House of Lorraine, forced Brittany's surrender. While it was too late to annul the marriage, with Jean having consummated it, the Treaty of Le Verger effectively saw Brittany annexed into the French crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS2.T; History of the Dual-Monarchy ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS2.D;The Reformation presented new challenges to the unity of the thrones. The deep involvement of the Valois in aiding Zwingli's escape from Papal and Imperial imprisonment was too good a pretext to end any alternate succession, causing the Languedoc War (1532), and ending with the conquest of Languedoc & Auvergne, leaving only a rump Provencal state in the Azure Coast and in Rhone. In addition to the affairs of Provence, it also engaged in what became known as the Great Game with the Kingdom of Burgundy and the Crown of Aragon. The subject of these wars of influence came about with Navarre (which saw the conquest of the County of Foix & Bearn in 1516), the Italian Peninsula (which ended largely as a victory for the Aragonese, as most of the Peninsula, save Savoy, Genoa, Milan, and the Emilian Dukedoms fell under their influence, compared to only Savoy for the Dual Monarchy), and even the County of Provence (which easily fell into the Aragonese camp to save them from being destroyed by the Plantagenets.);;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS3.T; The History of the Dual-Monarchy ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS3.D;While aggressively fighting heresy abroad the Kings of Both Thrones were initially tolerant of Protestants. King Francois I was torn between dynastic links to the firmly Catholic Jagiellons of Bohemia and a large portion of his populace firm in their new faith. Further strife in England and in Aquitaine combined with the growing threat of Burgundy (long the champion of the Protestant cause) tipped the balance leading first to the Anglo-French Wars of Religion (1598-1614) both within the Kingdom and among its neighbors, and later after the defeat of the Protestants, the Exodus of the Protestant Huguenots to Burgundy, Scandinavia and Colonial New Burgundy (now the Seven Republics) and the Anglican Father Pilgrim and their followers to what they would call New England (now Beornia).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS4.D;While England was briefly a viceroyalty under the Dukes of Gloucester, the throne would be forever undivided following the dissolution of the English Parliament by Henry VII in 1537, and its merging into the Estates General. The nobility with the exception of some distant provinces converged increasingly to Paris as French, became the official language throughout both kingdoms. This led to the gradual Francification of England as once English names were increasingly replaced by French. By the turn of the 19th century, French has become the primary common language in the Southern parts of England. The concept of a centralized Parliamentary body was revolutionary for its time, and, almost ironically, would influence the future legislative bodies of the Burgundian Estates-General, the Savoyard Subalpine Senate, the Aragonese Cortes and the Scandinavian Riksdag, among other European states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS5.D;The Anglo-French history in Ireland was also something of a peculiar moment. During the French Wars of Succession, English, and later Anglo-French control of the Island was left in the hands of the House of Fitzgerald, the Earls of Kildare as much time was spent in building a new administrative apparatus for both England and France. Because of this, the Kildares, along with the House of Desmond, both began to rule Ireland as if it was their own Kingdom. The issues, which had been building up during the twilight years of the reign of Henri VIII culminated in the three Irish Wars (1573-1579, 1583-1594 and the Nine Years’ War, 1598-1607). Which gradually saw Ireland pacified, the rebel Irish Lords killed and the King of England and France reaffirmed as Lord of Ireland. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS6.D;With the unexpected ascension of James IV of Scotland to the Throne of the North in 1500 the Plantagenêts faced the threat of encirclement by the alliance of Burgundy and the former. The exodus of the early 17th century was compounded by wars against Burgundy and Scandinavia pushing emigration to the colonies of Plantagenia and Amazonie. However the pushing towards these colonies were not without strife there as well, as conflicts were rife between Colonial Vinland and New Burgundy, as well as against the Cherokee and Creek, among other First Nation Tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS7.D;Eventually, the Dual Monarchy secured its position as the unquestioned power in Western Europe amid the gradual decline of Spain. A period of relative peace in Europe allowed the Dual Monarchy to expand its influences abroad. The Dual Monarchy established trading posts along the coast of Sierra Lionne, allowed them to trade European goods for slaves to be sent to the New World. A series of wars with the Kingdom of Kandy (1696-1703, 1705-1715, 1716-1717) saw the entirety of Ceylon becoming an Anglo-French crown colony, allowing access to the Indian Ocean Trade through good relations with the Nasirid Sultans of Bengal. At the same time there was a great degree of expansion in the Anglo-French colonies in the New World, as colonial conflicts with Scandinavia, Burgundy and Spain, reinforced its mother country’s position. This period of colonial expansion was broken with the War of the Anglo-French Succession, leading to the independence of Plantagenia under a cadet branch of the House of Plantagenêt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS8.D;Remaining largely aloof during the opening stages of the Great German Wars allowed the industrial revolution to take hold and the Dual Monarchy seemed set to dominate this new realm as well. But the battles of the later war quickly demonstrated that the old rival Burgundy was again on the rise as even beaten and battered it remained victorious, losing only its other colony Amazonie to independence. The Dual Monarchy enters the middle of the 19th century as the ultimate global power, but for the first time in over a century its position does not appear unassailable in Anvers and courts beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM1.T;Administration of Gran Colombia ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM1.D;We have reconquered Gran Colombia but now we have to administrate it. We could keep the rebellious colonies under our direct control but it has proved to be inefficient and one of the causes of the rebellion. We could then allow some home-rule with a direct administrator from Spain to rule over the colonies. The question is then how to divide the area : along the old vice-royalties or on a smaller basis ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLMcusco.T;The question of Cuzco ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLMcusco.D;The old imperial city of the Incan Empire is in our hands since the end of the rebellion. Cuzco has been under our control since 1575 but the area is still predominantly inhabited by Quechua people and few have adopted our customs. Some in our government have suggested to give the territories depending of the Arequipa Capitancy to the Incan Empire to thank them for their intervention during the war. Although they were forced to surrender, the Incans decided the issue of the war by killing the Rebel leader Bolivar. Ceding Cuzco would surely assure us a period of peace in Colombia and ease the tensions that have accumulated over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLM_lib1.T;The end of the rebellion ;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLM_lib1.D;The rebels have spread liberal ideas throughout Colombia and many people in our colonies are inclined toward these. Many of the soldiers fighting in the war have heard of them and it seems the liberal hydra will be hard to stop. We can choose to keep absolutism and force the colonies to bow before our representatives. However reconciling with them by allowing them to elect their government under our supervision will be appreciated over the Atlantic but will create dissent here in Spain. Or more simply we could grant a Constitution to both the Colombians and the Spanish peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM16.D;After a long and bloody war, Mexican representatives have agreed on peace with the Spanish crown. Gran Colombia is recognized as an independent nation but all the territories dependent of the old vice-royalty of Granada along with Andagoya will be ceded to Spain. Already, crowds are gathering in Nova Lisboa and San Salvador to blame the Mexican government and the so-proclaimed president Miranda for the defeat. What will happen to the Federation ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM17.T;Administration of Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM17.D;The treaty of Cartagena has left us with many possibilities in Ameriga. We could maintain the old order but at the cost of increased rebellions or allow home-rule.

CLM18.D;With the signature of the peace of Cartagena, the hold of Mexico over the Federation has loosened. Both Lusitanian and Mesoamericans are asking for a congress to be held in Mexico to decide of the future of the federation. However many generals fear the outcome of this session and partisans of the war hero Santa Anna want him to take command. Such a move would however only increase the various independentists movements... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM23.D;The Federation has lived but even Mexico is crumbling under the independists demands. Determined to get their independence, the Lusitanian and Mesoamerigan representatives have turned the natives against the old government, each asking a country on their own. The military has now retired to Jalisco, the only province they have managed to retain ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM24.T;The Veracruz Plan ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM24.D;Maintaining Order in Gran Colombia has been hard since the accession of Santa Anna to Presidency. Liberals are criticizing "the extraordinary measures" took by Santa Anna and some already think that Spanish domination would be softer than the one imposed by the Mexican miltary. To help fight the secessionist movements in Lusitania and Mesoamerica, Santa Anna has met in Veracruz with Inacio Madeira and José Morazan. The first is a Lusitanian war hero who has led the recapture of Nova Lisboa in the last moments of the war and thus acquired a prestigious figure in Lusitania. The second is the symbol of assimilation of the Native populations, his family indeed originates from Mayan caciques who then became great figures in San Salvador. A leader of the independence war, he is revered by both Mayan and Mesoamerigan populations. Along with these two prominent figures, Santa Anna has designed a plan which divides the country into three spheres of influence until the Federation is ready to fight once more the Spanish.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HRE9.T;The Prague Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE9.D;After having reaffirmed his hegemony over the various principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, the emperor, Sigismund V has issued a Proclamation destined to all the members of the Imperial Diet. Determined to pursue the reforms of centralization advocated by his father Wenceslaus VIII during the German Wars, the emperor asks all the princes of the empires to join in a single state from the Danube to the Elbe. Should the Empire be centralized it would mean an upheaval of the balance of powers on the continent but nothing is set in stone for now. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE10.T;The Reactions towards the Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE10.D;The Proclamation has had various results throughout the Empire. Already all the good princes have joined the Reich !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE11.T;The Prague Proclamation : Success  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE11.D;The majority of the princes and free cities of the Empire have accepted the Proclamation. The discordant voices are alone amongst this common sentiment. The Emperor is really now the king of the Germans and to give them guarantees he already moved his court to Frankfurt am Main where all the institutions will be centralized. However this move has angered the Bohemians who don’t accept to be the heart of the Empire and the idea of secession is brewing in the mind of some.  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE12.T;The Prague Proclamation : Complete Failure  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE12.D;Instead of achieving a centralized empire the Proclamation launched the contrary move. All German princes ahve united and are marching toward Prague ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

HRE50.T;Bohemian nationalism ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE50.D;"Lion over Eagle!" "We are no Germans!" "Down with the traitor!" These and many more shouts can be heard almost everyday in Prague, Pilsen, Brünn,...The Bohemian people feel betrayed by the recent development in the realm and they fear that their privileged position they have been enjoying as citizens of the Imperial heartland for centuries is waning. Is it a sign of things to come ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE51.T;Bohemian riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE51.D;It started as a meaningless brawl. One drunk Bohemian anti-Imperialist was loudly swearing and a nearby walking police officer tried to calm him down, only to be punched to the face. When the officer tried to defend himself, the drunk pulled a knife, the policeman panicked and shot him in the chest. Other Bohemians seeing that promptly killed the officer, stormed a close weapons depot and started building a barricade in one of the city's streets. Looks like trouble is brewing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE54.T;The Bohemian Revolution !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE54.D;"To arms! To arms! For our freedom and our pride! Down with the German tyranny!" After a series of incidents following the unification of the Holy Roman Empire and the subsequent centralisation acts, the situation in Bohemia escalated in a full-blown crisis. Bohemian aristocrats formed a national assembly and declared the Bohemian Crown Lands independent from the rest of the Empire. Disgruntled Bohemians, joined by many veteran soldiers of Holy Roman armies are already flocking to their ranks, gearing for war. Is peace in central Europe really a dream impossible to come true? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE55.T;Intervention in Mitteleuropa ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE55.D;With the Bohemians rebelling, we have a chance to cripple the Kaiserreich. For glory ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE56.T;Independence ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE56.D;At last we have succeeded. The war cost us many lives but we have secured our homeland from the traitor Kaiser ! Let it be known that Bohemia will never bow again before the Germans ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE57.T;Bohemian Mobilisation ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE57.D;Now it is obvious that the war between the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia will be fought on a scale never seen before. The Bohemian citizens are en masse joining the Free Corps and donating their belongings to the war effort. The story of a girl who, having no other property or money, donated a lock of her hair is just one of the many. The Bohemian lion is now standing tall, ready to take on his enemies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE58.T;Prague is lost ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE58.D;Ein Reich, ein Deutschland. That's easier to say than to fulfil. The Bohemians decided not to be just regular members of the Holy Roman Empire and somehow managed to defeat our newborn country, striking a deep wound into its flesh. With the blue-red-white tricolour flying over the Prague Castle, they have lost the chance to be full citizens of the Empire. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE59.T;The Revolution was crushed ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE59.D;Ein Reich, ein Deutschland. Only fools would want to stand against the wind of destiny. The foolish Bohemians have tried to do just that and paid the price of blood for it. But our Empire has bled, too, and so it is important that the peace shall now rule in Mitteleuropa for eternity. And thanks only to our glorious nation. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CRO1.T;Illyrian Brothers ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CRO1.D;The ongoing Ottoman Civil war present us with an interesting choice right now. We have asserted our independence from the Empire recently and we have become a beacon of hope for the Slav populations living under the Muslim yoke. A proposition was made recently to enter a war against the Empire to free Serbia before Hungary or another vulture takes the territory for itself. Or we could just wait for the Empire to be in an even worse situation and take the territory for ourselves ….  ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CRO7.T;Intervention in Montenegro ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO7.D;Before the Civil War, Montenegro was divided in various principalites. The Metropolitan finally achieved unification around him and went on expelling the powerful Simic family which ruled Kotor. The heir to the war hero Peter Simic, Joseph Simic is an idealistic panslavist and he has many times confessed that his father wanted Montenegro to join the Illyian kingdom. We could let him act and enter Montenegro with followers to see if we could not force the Metropolitan to bow before us. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO8.T;The Simic rebellion ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO8.D;The Illyrian have allowed the claimant to the dukedom of Montenegro, Jospeh Simic to sneak into Kotor where he actually tries to convince people to join our heretic neighbour.

CRO13.T;The status of Belgrade ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CRO14.T;Illyrian Ultimatum ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO14.D;The Illyian King has issued a declaration in which he demands us to relinquish the Serbian lands we captured during the Civil War. The Serbs have been restless around their old capital and holding unto them will harm relations with our allies. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

anglois_language_schooling_title;Anglois education;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
anglois_language_schooling_desc;Education is becoming a rather central subject in Anglois politics. All politics except the most conservative are in favor of standardizing education, making it free and open to all children, to make them future responsible citizens. The main problem of this law is that the question of languages has not been settled yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA130.T;Anglois education;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA130.D;Two camps oppose in the question of education. First, the "Federalists" want to allow our accepted minorities to continue to use their language in school along with the standardized language of Paris. The "Unionists" want to affirm one language to strenghten the state around one people, speaking one language. Our decision will not only affect education and the removal of the local dialects in school will mean their slow disappearance of the Anglois society. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TUS_setupT;The political situation in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TUS_setupD;Etruria is the last remaining republic born during the German Revolution. The revolutionaries expelled the Valois-Medici and created sister republics all throughout the peninsula but were forced to negotiate peace and leave the Reaction take over the new Republics. Italy is now as divided as before the Revolution and Etruria is no longer perceived as the hegemon of Italy. Internally, the Priors, whose main base in Florence are the Uffizi and the Piaza Dei Priori, hence their name, rule now again the republic but they are challenged on their left by the Carmagnolesi, the hardcore revolutionaries. On their right the Peasants do not want the Revolution to go further and the Compromisers want Peace in Italy. Some Provenzale supporters still dream of the return of the Valois-Medici but forces of Reaction are weak. If Etruria can surpass petty political rivalries then maybe they'll be able to unify Italy and threaten the old European Order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR1.T;The Carbonari;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
ETR1.D;The Counter-revolution may have won in Italy because of superior numbers but the spirit of the Revolution still lives on. Many leaders of the sister republics have fled to Etruria and the carbonari circles number great officials of the reactionary states. With liberalism ideas spreading once again we could activate the Carbonari cells all over Italy to spread the Revolution but then we need to be sure of holding back the forces of reaction... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR2.T;Carbonari uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR2.D;The Etrurians are once again causing trouble in Italy... The supporters of the liberal ideas who are members of the carbonari secret society have used their influence in the government and the military to cause problems!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ETR9.T;Andrea Doria;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR9.D;The famous Doria family is one of the most powerful Genoan aristocratic families. Members of the family have held offices throughout the history of the Republic : admirals, condotierri, politicians … Andrea Doria held the highest position of the Republic when the Etrurian Revolution happened. Inspired by Enlightenment ideas he allied with Etruria and promulgated several laws in favour of the lower classes of the Republic. The oligarchs fled to Savoy after the Dorian supporters proclaimed the Republic of Liguria. However after we signed peace with Aragon the oligarchs were soon put back by a joint Anglois-Savoyard coalition and Andrea Doria and its government fled to Firenze where he has lived since.. But now we have activated our cells in Italy Andrea has embarked on a boat toward Genoa. We hope he can liberate his homeland from oligarchs and Anglois influences! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR10.T;The Thousand Dorians;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR10.D;Doria, the Consul of the short lived Republic of Liguria has decided to come back to Genoa! The current government is quite threatened by this situation. The old system was only re-established with the help of the Duke of Savoy and the Anglois Mediterranean fleet. The crowds are already cheering for his return and a small garrison has defected to him. “The Thousands” as they are called are ready to enter Genoa proper : the government can rally the loyalists and crush the coup or let the Dorians take back power and re-establish the republic of Liguria. What will happen ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR11.T;The failure of the Thousands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR11.D;Andrea Doria and his followers have been executed by the oligarchs of Genoa! The reactionary forces rallied and shot the crowd who came to cheer for the reestablishment of democracy in Genoa. It seems that the ‘incident’ has been told to the Anglois king who has said that Italy needed to be watched.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR12.T;Francesco Pepe;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR12.D;During the Etrurian War our armies successfully vainquished the Papal forces and went on to invade Sicily. The whole Naples kingdom was captured thanks to the Neapolitan general Francisco Pepe who established the Parthonopean Republic from the name of the nymph Parthonopee associated with the city of Naples. Alas the Aragonese regrouped and the Republic was dissolved and its officials fled to Etruria. Francisco Pepe has embarked yesterday to Naples without alerting our government to propagate the Revolution. We had been prudent in our actions until now toward the Aragonese Crown but now who knows what might happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
ETR13.T;Rebellion in Naples!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR13.D;Rumors say that Francisco Pepe, the Neapolitan traitor who led the Parthonopean Republic during the German Wars has come back to our demesne and has instigated rebellion in our provinces of Southern Italy. Police is searching him but with no success until now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR14.T;Francesco Pepe has entered Napoli! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR14.D;The Carbonari in Naples have began to instigate rebellion in Parthonopea thanks to the leadership of Francesco Pepe. Aragon might not receive the news well though....;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR15.T;Execution of Francesco Pepe;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR15.D;Francesco Pepe, the traitor responsible for the defection of Naples during thez German Wars has been arrested while trying to cross the border to our territories. He has been arrested and then executed in public in Napols. Many officials point at Etruria for being responsible of this act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR16.T;Francesco Pepe is dead!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR16.D;Francesco Pepe has been arrested by the Aragonese while crossing the Roman border. The Aragonese are blaming our Republic for 'threatening the Order in Italy'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR17.T;Renewing the Etrurian Wars;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
ETR17.D;Etruria has become a threat to our leadership in Italy once more. Their agents have disrupted order in all Italy and recently in our provinces. We have to act against the Republic to really become once again the greatest power of Italy!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR18.T;Revolt in Naples;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
ETR18.D;Francesco Pepe and his followers have declared the Parthonopean republic anew! This diversion will surely be a nuisance in our war against the Etrurians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR20.T;Lucca ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR20.D;The Armies of the Republic have eventually annexed the city of Lucca. The city was annexed during the Italian Wars but Aragon forced us to let them go during the treaty ending the War. But now the Republic is indivisible!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR21.T;Emilia in the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR21.D;Emilia once divided between the small principalities of Modena and Parma is now united under the republic. The area was a part of the Republic during the Revolution and shall now always be!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR22.T;Romagna in the Republic ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR22.D;The old republic of Cispadana has integrated Etruria. The Romagnans threw off the Duke of Ferrara after we expelled the Provenzale and the sister republic fought with us for the whole year. Eventually they were annexed by Aragon who put a puppet on the throne. But now they shall be forever be our brethern!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR23.T;Unita!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
ETR23.D;Italy has been united! Now the little states that constituted North Italy are but a memory and we shall never be divided again !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR24.T;The Greek Problem;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR24.D;Greece was 'protected' by the Serenessima after the Ottoman Civil War. TWe are now in possession of these lands and some have suggested to give all Greece autonomy. It is true that the whole country is hard to manage but others have proposed to keep Crete and Cyprus which possess a large Venetian community.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
ITA1.T;La Questione Meridionale;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA1.D;The Mezzogiorno has been freed from Aragon but the differences with the rest of Italy are still important. Industry is flourishing in Lombardia and the rest of Northern Italy while the Southern provinces are still primarily rural. The Northern Italian people control most of the offices of government and the South is feeling neglected. Resentment is high in the Catalan speaking communities that are dispersed throughout the Two-Sicilies and who regret the rule from Barcelona. Our government officials have observed lately an increase of departures to the New World and it seems that if we do nothing then the phenomena will become more important... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA2.T;The Arborean Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA2.D;Sardinia and Corsica are the most problematic provinces of Italy. Despite their annexation to the Italian state governing is hard because of the isolation of the islands and of the number of Catalan people throughout the island. Unified Italian is barely spoken even in the ports and vendettas between rival families are still common with the authorities unable to discourage them. Recently entire families have been seen leaving the ports to the New-World and officials fear that it could be the beginning of an important emigration movement. A solution has been drafted to include the locals better into Italy but it comes with a cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA3.T;Venetian Complaints;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA3.D;The Venetian people was for the greater part neutral in the process of independence, not associating with the unification process. Eventually they joined their brethren but many of the locals feel betrayed by the Roman government that has stripped them from their privileges. We can try to improve the situation or let it go which will surely trnaslate into numerous departures towards the New-World and increased dissent in the remaining Venetians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA4.T;The New Republics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA4.D;The Dual-Monarchy has imploded and 4 new republics have been carved out of the corpse. We represent the success of the revolutionary ideal and both the French and Occitan republics look upon us to lead the way in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER1.T;The Congress of Roma;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER1.D;Roma, the Eternal City and our capital is hosting a German Congress with representatives coming from across the Alpes en masse. Mainly hardcore republicans, this Congress allows the different factions to regroup around one objective : German unity. The President of Italy will soon be making a speech in front of these radicals and many fear that he will actively join them and wreak havoc in Germany once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER2.T;A Secret Pact with Paris ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER2.D;We have announced our support of the German republicans but now we have to face the fact that we will be alone in this fight against two of the greatest European Powers. The government fears that Italy and the Danubians might clash with too many forces and so some have suggested to send an envoy to Paris, suggesting them that we could have no problem with them getting Bourgogne if they were to intervene in Germany...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER3.T;An Italian proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER3.D;The Italian ambassador has contacted us about a secret pact between our governments.

GER21.T;The Berlin uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER21.D;Dissent has been high in the Elbian populations under the heel of the Bohemian Emperor. Ever since the recent conquest of Pomerania the Northern regions of Germany have been a revolutionary nest opposing the domination of the Bohemian elites. Yesterday  a group of students has launched a violent demonstration in Berlin that ended with the local police completely overwhelmed. The surrounding areas have now rebelled against Bohemia, joining the fight with the Danubians!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER24.T;Unrest in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER24.D;The annexation of the Pomeranian lands have increased the dissent from the German nationalists. The radicals have met yesterday in Berlin and drafted a plan for an Elbian 'League' to arise and push back the forces of the 'false-emperor'. Hopefully we encountered the threat and most of them are now either in exile or prison but it seems their idea is gaining weight in the local population.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER25.T;Unification ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER25.D;The Danubian Federation and the League of Berlin share the same agenda : the unification of Germany. Representatives from both states have argued about unifying the two leading forces of Germany into one. Should we propose it ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DZG1.T;The Khanate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG1.D;The Khanate of Dzungaria is the last great remnant of the Mongolian Empire. Founded by OIrat Mongol in the XVIIth century it grew in importance in the following century unifying the Mongolian camps and vainquishing the Qing during several campaigns. It is said that it’s thanks to the Oirat that China is not dominated by the Manchu. The actual Khan, Galdan converted to Islam following his conquests of Samarkand and khiva but has shown tolerance towards the Buddhists lamas of his realm. While already aged he has said he wanted to advance into China but already his sons want to divide the Khanate following their desires…. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG2.T;The death of Galdan Khan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG2.D;Galdan Khan, the supreme chief of the Asian steppe died yesterday at the venerable age of 76 years. The size of the Khanate combined with the ambitions of his sons has seen the Empire already divided, each army pledging an oath to a different son. The heir Tushiyetu has seized the crown lands of Dzungaria but he now must choose : will he try to stop his brothers’ ambition or will he completely let the Empire disrupt ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG3.T;Reclaiming the Tarim Basin;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG3.D;The Khan let his brothers disrupt the Khanate years ago but Uyghurs have been a thorn in our side for too long! They often pose problems in Urumqi siding in feuds of their community and trade routes have been let to waste under their rule. The Oirat must step up and take back this territory in memory of our great Khans!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG4.T;The legacy of Genghis ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG4.D;The Khanate of Mongolia is our principal opponent in the area. The Mongols are our direct brothers compared to the Turkic people of the Steppes but their leader is too ambitious to accept our hegemony without fighting. Some call on to our leader to use the new knowledge he gained to strike at our enemies and see them submit once again before their rightful Khan! ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG5.T;Submitting the Kazaks ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG5.D;The Kazakh Khanate lies in the steppes of the West. With our base secured in the East there has been talk about annexing back the Kazakhs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG6.T;The Tuvan Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG6.D;Tannu Tuva is a desolate frozen place. Sitting on the north of our border, we have little interest in attacking them but it would be nooying that someone else took the lands instead of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG7.T;Modernization of the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG7.D;The Western World is coming to the Asian Steppe. We feel it everyday with new ideas spreading through the old Silk Road. Fortunately we are isolated naturally with Siberia and the Divided China not allowing the Europeans to approach our cities and peoples. But the Khan has had enough. Japanese, Russians, all are looking into the Future and they will surely threaten the Oirat when they are ready. To this extent the Khan has gathered a little group tasked to find help in this modernization process but where shall they be sent ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG8.T;Coming back from the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG8.D;Our expedition has eventually come back from the West! They have brought with them limitless knowledge on politics, science and war. They have also established contact with most of the khans of Europe, who for most of them did not know the existence of our glorious country! To serve as military advisers they have also hired ‘Cossacks’, great warriors from the Western Steppes they claim. Their leader the Baron Roman Stroganov-Romanov, a disinherited noble has made a great impression to the Khan but he seems to be an ambitious man, full of eccentricities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG9.T;The Cossack Baron;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG9.D;Roman Stroganov-Romanov is a strange man but he has found his home here in the open steppe, riding a horse with a falcon on his wrist and feeling the wind in his hair. His military ability in the recent campaigns is worthy of praise. Despite his foreign background he is well perceived by the quriltai. We could nominate him as our right arm, ‘Minister’ as they say in the ‘civilized’ states, make him the leader of our forces or order him to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG10.D;Tibet is the religious center of the Buddhists of Central Asia. The dalai-lamas were installed rulers thanks to the Oirat two centuries ago and we have thus acquired a special place in Tibetan affairs. The current Dalai-lama is rebellious and has vigorously condemned our expansion through Asia. Our European minister has proposed we conduct a punitive expedition to make the Dalai-lama understand his place and why not recuperate some territories settled by Nomads ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DZG13.T;The Asiatic Legions;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG13.D;Our minister Stroganov-Romanov has been pushing for some time for a modernization of our armies. He wants to institute 'Asiatic' Legions with professional officers trained with mixed European and Chinese tactics. This project is widely refused by our traditional belligerent elite and the actual officers who might lose their position. But if the reforms were to pass we would then acquire an ascendant on our neighbours !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG14.T;The Mad Baron;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG14.D;Since he was left on his own in the steppe by the Oirat Stroganov-Romanov has been going mad. Lately he has assembled a whole corp of cavalry, delcaring his intention to build a Great Empire to purge back Europe. Thus he has attacked the Khan in Ugra to take power in Mongolia. If he wins he has declared that the Oirat would be next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG15.T;Mongolian attack;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG15.D;Stroganov-Romanov has taken control of Mongolia and has decided to 'purge us' for our faults!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG20.T;The Creation of the Urumqi university;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG20.D;Amongst the men who came back from their mission to the outer world years ago, a wealthy Uygur from Urumqi has decided to build a library in our capital and has asked for our patronage. The collection is limited, consisting mostly of Buddhist treaties and Qur’ans but he says that he could try to buy them abroad with our help. Moreover he says we could establish an institute tasked of educating the children of our nation and help the development of our growing bureaucracy. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG21.T;Cave paintings;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG21.D;Our University still growing has welcomed several European archaeologists following certain discoveries in the Tarim basin. Apparently European looking people appear in cave paintings from the area and it has interested many archaeologists. What should we do about this discovery ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG22.T;The Tocharians;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG22.D;Central Asia has entered on the world stage following the recent findings of archaelogists in the Tarim Basin. Cave findings and other remains have made the world discover a new civilization there, since long dead but who seems to be the Tokharoi described in the Greek texts. Anyway these findings have increased the prestige of the Oirat state which despite his entrance in the Modern World is still very isolated. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG23.T;The question of script;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG23.D;The National Library of Urumqi is filling with books since our investment! But our scholars have asked ourselves which script we should use for the translation of foreign books into our language. Central Asia has been using plenty of ways of writing : Muslim elites often use Arabic, merchants used Chinese, monks use Tibetan... A Mongol script was created by Genghis Khan and is still enduring. We could also adapt the Latin alphabet to our needs and become closer to the Western World or promulgate Arabic to please the Muslim populations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG30.T;A Dzungar caravan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG30.D;Yesterday a ship brought several Oirat men with gifts from the Khan in Urumqi. They have asked us to study here in Japan for a while before going back to their homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG31.T;Return from Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG31.D;Our chosen men who travelled to Japan have come back filled with new knowledge gained in the Japanese universities. A lot of them have come to consider Japan as a natural ally for our country and with them getting new positions at the court, the Tenno can count on several allies in Urumqi.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG32.T;A Japanese Request;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG32.D;Yesterday a caravan has arrived from Japan with a letter from the Emperor. He asks us to protect a group of Buddhist monks who want to travel to Tibet without crossing the ever-warring China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG33.T;A Japanese lama;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG33.D;Yesterday a caravan arrived from Urumqi with several Japanese monks who have come to study our sacred texts and establish better relations between Japan and Tibet. Their leader Kawaguchi has already gained the support of the current dalai-lama, who considers him one of the most 'wise monks' he ever encountered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DZG35.T;Operation Tsunami;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG35.D;The Steppe is a hard place to control. Far from our Home Islands and empty they only have interesting ressources. It is thus more interesting to use 'friendly regimes' to rule over these populations. The Dzungar Khanate would be a fine target as a puppet of our glorious nation and would enhance our position as masters of Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DZG41.T;Return from $FROMCOUNTRY_CAPITAL$$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG41.D;Our delegation has finally made its way back to Urumqi! They have spent many months in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attending to universities and military schools. They seem to have been quite the attraction in Europe from what they say and we are now known to European courts as an effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG42.T;'Travels to Europe';;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG42.D;The imam who travelled to Europe with the delegation has published a book describing the trip he made to Europe. The great sense of detail of the book along with the reflexion on the Western Civilization has charmed our literate elite!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME135100;Dahomey Refuses to Pay Tribute;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135100;To ensure the peace between our nations, Dahomey has been paying us tribute ever since the 18th century. It has become tradition at this point, but Dahomey has just rejected it. The tribute was the only thing keeping us from attacking them, now we let's show them why they paid it in the first place!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135101;We Have Won The War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135101;We have managed to keep our independence and are no longer obligated to pay tribute to the Oyo Empire. This is a great day for our nation. Let the flag of the elephant fly in the winds!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135102;We Have Lost The War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135102;It is a dark day for our nation, we tried to break free and we failed. This was not the day of the flag of the elephant...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135103;The Dahomey Amazons;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135103;The Dahomey Amazons were originally established as a group of female elephant hunters in the 17th century by King Houegbadja, in the early 18th century his son, King Agaja, made them into the bodyguards of the king, armed with muskets. According to tradition, Agaja also developed them into a militia that helped win a war against the Kingdom of Savi. What their job in the army always has been is just to hold banners to make the army seem bigger than it actually is, however some suggest that we might make even better use of them if they were turned into an actual female corp that'd fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135104;Ideas of Absolutism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135104;The idea of an absolute monarch being able to rule better than a feudal one is spreading throughout the kingdom, although not widespread it continues to be more and more popular. They are taking the European states and some of our neighbors as proof of absolutism being better, seeing as many of them seem to be more successful. Maybe we can capitalize on this and abolish the stubborn tribes of our Kingdom?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135105;Slave Market Failing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135105;The market for slavery is doing worse and worse everyday, people don't want to buy new ones and instead try to sell their old ones. Some of the reasons for this are that slaves have demanded more and more rights under the years and you now have the responsability of taking care of your slaves well being aswell as many slave revolts in the Kingdom resulting in several owners killed. The advisers are trying to come up with ideas with how we can fix this problem, but so far the only options we seem to have are either loosening the restrictions on owning a slave and encouraging slavery amongst the farms or just completely abolish slavery as many consider it unethical aswell as it not being very benefitial for the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135106;The Culture of Dahomey;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135106;The culture in Dahomey has always been very distinct from elsewhere in Africa. Much of the arts are subsidized by the royal family and the artists aren't of any specific class, but instead can be created by anyone from a lord to a peasant. One of the many things that make our country so great is the Royal Palaces of Abomey which are several palaces spread over a large complex, every palace contains stone carvings depicting the many accomplishments of the king and every king had his own palace. There are two unique aspects of art in Dahomey, firstly it's the assembling of different components, using many different materials, and secondly it's the borrowing of culture from neighboring people. Some say our focus should lie in developing our own culture, but many are also intrigued by the cultures of the outside world. We could either focus on and subsidize our own local culture and develop it or we could embrace some of the western ideas in hopes of becoming more like them or we could embrace some of our islamic neighbors' traditions and learn from them instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135107;A Backward Country;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135107;While there's no doubt that our country is great and beautiful it is no lie that we are behind many other countries in the region, especially the European nations on the coast. We must combat this by developing our own country into something it couldn't even imagine a few generations ago. One of the biggest reasons the Europeans, and some of our neighbors, are so ahead is their academia, their's are much larger than ours. To be able to transform into a developed country we must increase it, however we're not completely sure of what the best way of doing do would be. Some say educating the people is the best way, just look at the literacy rate in Europe, while some say that we should just further educate what we have and refine it into an elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135108;Akans Raiding;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135108;Recently we've recieved several reports of of raidings from the Ewe chiefs, and all of them are claiming that the raiders are Akans. They are telling us that the raiders are coming on a weekly basis, stealing food and loot. Confronting some of the leaders of the Akan people they told us that they were former soldiers who pillaged for food and then claimed that they couldn't do anything about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC135109;Our nation has developed into something so magnificent, all of Africa adores it. Our great handling of diplomacy, economy and military has led us to this beautiful moment. The only question left is, where do we go now?

holy_crown_HUN_title;The Crown of San Stefen;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holy_crown_HUN_desc;The Holy Crown of Hungary, the very embodiment of our state is in the hands of the Bohemian Kings who still like to pretend they are claimants to the throne. Alas for us no Hungarian King can be considered truly worthy of ruling until he has been crowned with the Holy Crown of Saint Stefen, first King of Hungary. Now we can ask the Emperor to give us back the Crown but it will likely come with demands…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN1.T;An Hungarian Envoy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN1.D;The Holy Crown of Saint Stefen is the most important relics of Hungary. No Hungarian King could really be considered worthy of ruling until he had been crowned with this very Crown. The Kings of Bohemia have been in control of the Crown since the Ottoman Conquest, transferring the Crown in Prague where it would not be threatened. But the Dukes of Nitra we established to protect our lands proclaimed themselves Kings of Hungary following the expelling of the Turks. Gabriel I of Hungary has come to ask us to relinquish the Crown once and for all and is ready to “give in to any demands”.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN2.T;Bohemian Answer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN2.D;The Emperor has granted our request without any demands ! The Crown has been escorted to Budapest where Gabor I was formally crowned King of Hungary. It will surely inaugurate a new period of peace between our Kingdoms!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN3.D;The Emperor will only relinquish the Crown if we go to Prague and kneel before him. This move would damage our international status but we need it to secure our Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN4.T;Humiliation of Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN4.D; After negotiations the King of Hungary has come to Prague to regain the Holy Crown of Saint Stefen. The most precious relic of the Kingdom was only given to Gabor I after he knelt before the Bohemian Emperor in an humiliating ceremonial. The move has critically damaged the international standing of the Hungarian Kingdom along with their relations with Bohemia. One can guess that Bohemia made a serious enemy of her neighbour…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN5.T;End of negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN5.D;The King of Hungary has refused our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN6.D;The Bohemian Emperor has asked us to release a semi-independent Duchy of Nitra in exchange of the Crown of San Stefen. Nitra was the march installed by the Jagiellon to protect the Empire from Turkish attacks but it was ruled by Hungarian noblemen following the marriage between Charles Bethven and Maria Jagiellon, duchess of Nitra. The Hungarian revolution saw the duke of Nitra become King of Hungary by popular demands but it felt like an insult for Prague. Giving up full control on the duchy will surely be a thorn for our Kingdom but we would gain the Holy Crown…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN7.T;The New Duchy of Nitra;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN7.D;At our demand the King of Hungary has offered autonomy to the Slovaks and we have been allowed a right to intervene in their affairs;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN8.D;The Bohemians have refused to give us the Crown and they will refuse all concessions we might offer...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN9.T;Prague Heist!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN9.D;Stupor has struck Prague after an attempt by Hungarian nationalists to gain the Holy Crown! A dozen of Hungarian plotters bribed their way in the Castle of Prague and killed at least 27 guards before being caught. The question made them reveal that they were helped by the Hungarian government after the failure of negotiations to gain the Holy Crown. Such a slanderous behaviour needs to be addressed firmly without waiting for ‘apologies’. We’ll make Hungary pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN10.T;Heist Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN10.D;Our government had secretly funded Magyar nationalists to steal the Holy Crown in Prague and bring it to Budapest but the Heist did not go as planned. Now Bohemian Forces are mobilizing and we must now march to Prague and take back the Crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN11.T;Coronation of Gabor I;;;;;;;;;;;;x

INC_archa1.T;Machu Picchu;;;;;;;;;;;;x
INC_archa1.D;Machu Pichu, an old seat of power from the Great Incas, which no one visited for hundreds of years is once again under our control! Most of the knowledge about the mountain has been lost during the Spanish conquest and the few inscriptions we have tell us that it was Pachacuti himself who chose the site to be one of his residences. We have also found a great temple dedicated to Inti in the ruins and the priests of the Empire have asked that they be given the site to build a great sanctuary to honour Inti and the past Incas. The site would also be a magnificent retreat for our sovereigns if we renovated the whole place. Also the European advisers of our court have expressed their interest in funding missions to study this example of our old Civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

124203.T;Semi-Failure of the Italian Council;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124203.D;The Council of Italy has led to the enlargement of the Etrurian republic but it was not sufficient to really create an Italian state. It seems though that Italian unification might be done in a few years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124211.T;Monarchists dominate the debates;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124211.D;The debates on the future of Italy have been divided since the start between Etrurians and Monarchists. Lately the monarchist orators have been better than their Etrurian counterparts and have thus gained some influence in the Council.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

124213.T;Papal Sanction for Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124213.D;The Pope, being the head of the Church command a wide respect amongst the faithful in Italy -and abroad. So when he declared that the idea of Italian unification was a noble idea worth of being pursued helped the cause of the Etrurians. Of course his critics on secularism, liberalism and his secular power were left out of the newspapers... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124214.T;Papal Hostility to the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124214.D;The Pope, the head of the Catholic Church has issued an encyclical against the 'sins' of Etruria and calling for the good Christians to denounce their behaviour and their ideas. Religion is an important societal component and his actions have left the Etrurians weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124215.T;Critics on Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124215.D;Etruria is far from being respected amongst the European powers and it has thus been hard for them to appear as the obvious leader of the Italians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124216.T;Anglois bribes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124216.D;Since their conquest of Provence the Dual-Monarchy has been interested in creating an Italian state favorable to their interests. Recently we have heard that some members of the Council would have changed their stance following 'gifts' from Paris, thus hampering our progess toward Italian unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Andagoya1.T;Debates in the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya1.D;The Congress that opened to decide the future of Gran Colombia is divided into three great tendencies : Miranda and the united Colombians want the current situation to endure and Spaniards to take over the New-World, Granadans separatists want to leave the Federation thinking Mexico has taken too much power and finally the Federalistas want to return to smaller republics and end Mexican hegemony over Lusitanians and Salvadorians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya2.T;Trouble in the streets;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya2.D;Nobody knows how it exactly happened and who started these events but Salvadorians and Granadans have begun fights in Andagoya City. The Congress must decide who to support and who to blame. Punishing the Granadan leaders will help the Granadan cause while condemning the Salvadorians would help the cause of the Federalistas;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya3.T;Support of the Church;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya3.D;The Catholic Church has issued a decalration supporting the Union of all good Hispanic catholics into a single country, fearing that division would only lead to successes of liberals, atheists and Quechua pagans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya4.D;Even in the Church there exists division... The bishops of Granada have decided to support the Granadan independentists criticizing the power the Mexicans have accumulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya5.D;The dissensions amongst the Hispanic peoples are perceived even in the Roman Catholic Church! The archbishops stand divided, each supporting the local nationalists and refusing to allow Mexico to gain even more weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya6.T;The Colombian Army;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya6.D;Now that the war has ended many are questioning the role the Army should have in our state. The Tetrarchy of generals might have been a necessary evil but many Liberals fear that letting them keep some power will only only lead to coup d'Etats and could also lead ambitious men to secure personal power...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya7.T;The status of Indios;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya7.D;The native people have been freed from the previous colonial system of encomienda and castas but they are now asking for more power and representation in the state. Gran Colombia was founded as an Hispanic country and critics would fall down on the government if privileges were given to the 'Indios' and could potentially lead to the death of the Colombian Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya8.T;Abolition of Slavery;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya8.D;Slavery is a widespread pratice throughout Gran Colombia with Afro-Latino representing the second ethnic group in the Federation. It is also vital for the haciendas held by great landowners but also heavily criticized by many liberals who have decided to debate the issue in the Congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We tried to make him abdicate all claims on Tuscany, Provence and France but he is stubborn, refusing to deal with us. It leaves us in a problematic situation. Many in Etruria want to see him test the Fallschwermaschine after a 'fair trial' but it would also offense most of European monarchies ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VAL34.D;Yesterday a riot erupted in Avignon after a zealous Etrurian commissar had killed 'an enemy of the Revolution' without trial. Our supervizion of the new republic is increasing the dissent amongst the common man who doesn't understand why we are still here.

JAP23.D;We have acquired the rich Northern Tagalog islands in the South but our rule is challenged by the tribal kingdom of Tondo. It is time we end their independence and add them to our colonies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
JAP24.T;Claiming the Pacific islands;;;;;;;;;;;;x
JAP24.D;The Bonin islands are too close of the Home Islands to be let in the hands of the gaijin. With our navy reknowned in these seas our claim will easily be recognized!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accepting_athesia_title;Accepting the Athesians;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accepting_athesia_desc;The Venitian colonists who settled in Athesia have been restless since our takeover of the peninsula. Many share the same values as other Arcadians and if we make the right efforts they will be integrated without problems!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accepting_caribenos_title;The Caribenos;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accepting_caribenos_desc;The island of Kuba has seen the local settlers develop differently from both the Colombians and the Spanish. The island being in the center of the Caribbean Sea has seen countless traders land in Habana and Santiago and the local plantations are still profitable. Thus it could be easy to ensure our rule on the island by recognizing some autonomy and make the locals accept our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accepting_ayitians_title;Control of the Sudurhafeyjar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accepting_ayitians_desc;The Southern Islands, as they are called in Scandinavian, are home to an important population, one that has grown restless since our occupation of the islands began. They share many similarities with us and with the proper mesures taken we can easily make them accept our rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Western_border_treaty_title;Push to the West;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Western_border_treaty_desc;The unification of Arcadia has led to a great increase of immigrants arriving in our ports. The tension between the former hostile communities of the continent is not helping the new people to integrate efficiently in our country. Thus it was proposed to claim all territories which are currently not fully settled by the Sanbao government in exchange of a generous subsidy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC3.D;Qingqiu has refused to give up their territories!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC3.T;Refusal of Sanbao;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC2.D;The Arcadian star is growing like no ever state did in the New-World. The influx of migrants is impressive and they have offered to buy at a reasonable price all the territories we possess in the Rockies. It would be sad to give up all this territory we have acquired at the cost of many lives but can we face the full might of Arcadia ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC2.T;Abandoning our new territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC1.D;With out claims fully staked we can now ask Sanbao to relinquish all of our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC1.T;Claiming the Rocky Mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC4.T;The treaty of Sanbao;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC4.D;The Qingqiuan government has accepted the proposal of the Arcadian government and has relinquished all their claims outside their core territories on the West Coast of Arcadia. Many hope it will be sufficient to stop the greed for land of the new continental power...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Takikawa_title;Advancing into Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Takikawa_desc;The Kaiganese colony has always claimed the remote Takikawa region as her rightful lands and with Odensmark and Tangwan falling under the control of other powers it might be wise move to take this region too. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Takikawa_2_title;The Great North;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Takikawa_2_desc;The remote area of Takikawa was discovered by the Kaiganese at the beginning of the century but its remoteness and lack of ressources has left it empty. But now that all nearby territories are colonized it might be better for us to settle that territory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC5.T;Status of Xiazhou;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC5.D;Even if Sanbao signed the treaty it does not mean they accepted the loss of their northern states and the local community reminds us of it everyday.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCMEX1.T;The treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCMEX1.D;Arcadia was formed with Lusitania and they have claimed the whole old viceroyalty as an intgral part of their country. But many Spanish-speaking people are living the southern regions and our government has claimed them for quite a long time. Maybe it's time we let go these claims?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCMEX2.T;Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCMEX2.D;Arcadian diplomacy strikes another success as the government of Mexico accepted to relinquish their claims on Lusitania! It might be the beginning of a new era in Mexican-Arcadian relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ARCMEX3.D;The Mexican government has refused to accept to relinquish their claims...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR1.T;War in the steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR1.D;The vicious Muscovians are upon us! We must mobilize every men to fight back and keep the Russians out of the steppe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR2.T;Weakening Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR2.D;The Tsardom of Moscow is the fierciest rival of our Republic and they have invaded us too many times to remember. Despite the clauses of the peace of Prague they have decided to attack the Tatar khanates. We don't support the Tatars and we haven't forgotten the devastation they brought to Mother Russia but we can't let Moscow expand too much south. The knyaz has recommended to ask Copenhagen before any actions but perhaps it might be wiser to not do a thing at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR3.T;The Muscovian threat;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR3.D;Muscovy has been a thorn in the side of our Kingdom for much of the past centuries. The Republic of Novgorod, under our protection has asked us to help them in a puniive expedition aimed at weakening the Tsardom which is expanding in the Steppe. While it would be costly, it might be necessary in the long-term if we want to keep our influence in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR4.T;Scandinavian support;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR4.D;Our allies and protectors have lent us support in our enterprise. The Armies of the Republic shall march through Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR5.T;Scandinavian refusal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR5.D;Copenhagen is not interested in our expedition and has forbidden us from attacking Moscow...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR10.T;The Succession of Selim III;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR10.D;The problem of succession has plagued the various khanates of the steppe since their creation. Even Crimea, the most civilized of them does not escape this rule. Most of the time the question was ruled out by the Ottomans who chose woever pleased them the most. Selim III is aging and he has two sons fighting for the throne. Selim is like his father, traditional and afraid of the changes of the West. Murad is his opposite : he went to study in Istanbul where he became a reknowned scholar, even meeting the future king of Iraq and becoming an acquaintance of his. He then fought on the side of the Reformers in the Ottoman Civil War and now with the influence of Constantinople shrieking in the Black Sea, he has decided to come back. Selim has began to plot the death of his brother and who knows how it will end...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR11.T;Murad II;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR11.D;The Khan is dead, long live the Khan! Murad II, the reknowned general and scholar has succeeded in exiling his borther and taking the throne. he has promised to end obscurantism in the Khanate and restore the rightful place of the Tatars in the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR12.T;Adoption of the Latin alphabet;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR12.D;Out of the many reforms adopted by Murad II, the codification of Crimean Tatar language is often seen as one of his most important legacy. At his demand, many thinkers and scholars gathered to standardize the language and write it using the Latin Alphabet. It soon boosted the literacy of the people and helped the students to more easily learn the knowledges of the Western World.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR13.T;The end of raids;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR13.D;Raiding was the main activity of Crimea for centuries, the warriors of the steppes clashing with Polish, Moldavian, Russian and most of all Cossack forces in the open steppe of the Dniepr and the Don. Murad II decided to impose an edict forbidding raids in foreign countries. it was one of his many efforts to make the West acknowledge him as a civilized and also a great step towards the settlement of the nomad population of Crimea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR14.T;The unification of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR14.D;For far too long the Steppe warriors have clashed with each others instead of unite against their common foes. Murad II is decided to end the decay of the former Great Horde and he has seen how weak is the Astrakhan Khanate. Will he take the chance to force the Astrakhani bow before him or will he continue the modernization of his own Khanate ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR15.T;Conquest of Nogai;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR15D;Astrakhan has fallen and now only the Nogai Khanate resists the might of Crimea. It is time to end the division of the Steppe peoples and create the state of Tatarstan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ITASOC.T;Socialism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ITASOC.D;Italian politics have seen the rise of a new political movement : the Socialists. Inspired by the ideas of the Revolution this young movement has pledged to protect the people from its oppressors and press for more rights for the workers. Already similar movements have arisen throughout Europe and others civilized nations and their support of the masses could see a shif in politics. Inspired by their endeavour a young German called Marx has published the Communist Manifesto, which is already seen by some circles as the ideological pillar of the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME123111;Grossdeutschland;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC123111;Germany is now fully unifed but the problem of Bohemia is still there. Prague sits in the middle of the German lands and the hardcore nationalists call for the same treatment that the German nation received from Prague with the total occupation of the country. They are a minority, most of the complaints being about Silesia. The densely populated and industrialized region has many Germans around Breslau and Lower Silesia, making part of the Greater German Nation. Some also call for the annexation of whole Silesia, but most of the territories in the South are populated by Poles and Czechs. A pacifist minority call for a new era of relations with Bohemia with no reclamation of territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

334204.D;The Regency of Nanjing, the old capital of the first Ming and then Southern Ming dynasties, has been vanquished by our Emperor!

334205.T;Defeat of the Phoenix Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
334205.D;The traitorous Ming has been vanquished, his attempt at regaining the momentum crushed by our armies! We must now decide what will happen to our state : the Regency of Jiangsu was established by the prominent men of the Jiangsu area following the Fall of the Southern Ming to protect the interests of the province against the foreign Manchus and the fanatical Taiping. The oligarchy endured for more than a hundred years but now we stand at a crossroad : the ambitious general who was granted extraordinary powers for the duration of the war could proclaim himself Emperor with the support of the Army, the old oligarchy could restore the previous status quo or democrats could end the ambiguity and create the First Chinese Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
