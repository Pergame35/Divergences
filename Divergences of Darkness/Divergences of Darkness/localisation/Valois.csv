reclaim_occitania_desc;Even now that we are king of Italy we can't forget our claims in France. Our state is the reunion of many cultures, the French and Occitan having the same rights than the Italians we have united. We can't establish a Dual-Monarchy of France-Italy for now but we could claim the Mediterranean provinces of the usurpers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
venetians_culture_title;Integration of the Venetians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x       
venetians_culture_desc;The people under the government of the Serenissima have distinguished themselves from their Italians brothers because of their ties with the East. But now that Venice is in the hands of the Italian Nation, it is our duty to fully integrate them into our national fabric;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dominium_maris_baltici_desc; The greatest aspiration of the Kalmar Union has always been the complete control of the Baltic Sea. While the Scandinavians gained several holdings in the region, they still miss Prussia and the Lithuanian coast. Let us claim these areas for the glory of the Union ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

treaty_of_Corfu_desc;The Doge has been unable to take back the mainland. The war which erupted a while ago is drawing on its end and we are winning ! Aragon and Bohemia have offered to mediate in our advantage the signature of a treaty which will push Venice out of Hellas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
222120.T; Flight to Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
222120.D; The defeat is total for the Venetians. They have been pushed away from their homeland by the Italian nationalists. But they still hold many holdings in the East, where their government fled. Upon entering the city of Athens, the Doge was forced by the Greeks to proclaim an Hellenic Republic while still holding his old title. A new state has emerged from the ashes of the Serenessima, what will it become ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
ENL5.T;A Savoyard opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL5.D;For a long time we have coveted the Alpine passes held by the Duke of Savoy. The Dual-Monarchy faces open rebellion and is thus less inclined to protect the Duke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL6.T;Ultimatum from Antwerp;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL6.D;Burgundy asks us to relinquish our Alpine lands to integrate them into 'the Duchy of Geneva'. With the Dual-Monarchy facing harsh unrest we should not count too much on their protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL7.T;Savoyard Answer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
ENL7.D;The duke of Savoy has refused, meaning that only war will resolve the problem of the Alpes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL1.T;The restoration of order in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL1.D;The republic of Etruria is the threat to the Italian Order. While Aragon is reluctant to go to war against them, we haven't forgotten our right to the grand duchy of Tuscany. The various monarchs of North Italy would not react to this declaration because we would erase a threat to their personal power but Aragon would be angered by our demonstration of force. What do we choose ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
lucca_war_title;Pre-eminence in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
lucca_war_desc;The liberal republic of Etruria has been reduced to ashes with the King in France reclaiming his inheritance of Tuscany. But the duchy of Lucca has not accepted our renewed role in the area, proclaiming being freed from any feudal links toward us. While it is an obscure claim, we could always press it to strengthen our rule in Italy...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL3.T;The Provencal Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL3.D;The grand-duke of Tuscany and king of France has threatened us to press his rightful claim to our duchy if we do not bow to him. Many people in Italy would be eager to help us if the Valois would invade our duchy and a new anti-Valois league is slowly forming. Perhaps we are strong enough to force them to fall back ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL4.T;The Luccan league;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL4.D;We have been contacted by the duke of Lucca who has been threatened at multiple times by the king in France. He asks us to join a league against the Valois and free Tuscany from their hands if they dared take any action against the duchy. What do we do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL5.T;The Luccan league;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL5.D;The Valois have taken back Florence. Threatened by the renewed threat in the region, Lucca has asked us to back them against the ambitions of the kings in France. What do we do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL6.T;The Luccan league;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL6.D;We have been contacted by the duke of Lucca who has been threatened at multiple times by the king in France. He asks us to join a league against the Valois and free Tuscany from their hands if they dared take any action against the duchy. What do we do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL7.T;Response from Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL7.D;The duke of Lucca has refused to bow to our demands. Moreover he has apparently received the support of the various Italian principalites against us. We could take the chances and froce all Italians to bow before us but it would be a long and difficult war or we can still fall back our claims;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL8.T;Response from Lucca;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL8.D;The duke of Lucca has bowed to our demands. We are now in control of Lucca in all but name;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL9.T;The Valois attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL9.D;The Provencal have attacked our ally in Lucca. It is now our duty to take part in the oncoming war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VAL11.D;Now that Florence is free we will make peace with the Valois;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL12.T;The Italian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL12.D;A new war has erupted in Italy. Having regained Tuscany, the king in France has tried to extend his influence throughout the Italian states. But the Italian princes have now allied against him, and their armies are trying to push him out of Italy. This war puts the dream of a Valois kingdom of Italy at great risk, however if the Valois ever win this war, it could mark the birth of a new power in Southern Europe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL13.T;The Italian crown;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL13.D;Merging the Italian and Aragon crowns has been our goals for centuries. The pesky kings in France have claimed the Italian crown and are stirring the South Italian to revolt. We can't allow it. If we ever want to remain a great power then we must annex this upstart state in the North !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL14.T;The Italian war of Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL14.D;The king of Aragon has refused to acknowledge our right to the Italian Crown. They have issued a declaration of war against us to "take what is theirs". This war will define the very future of Italy. Will the Valois succeed or will the crown of Aragon emerge victorious ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL15.T;Savoyard Intervention ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL15.D;We have stayed out the Italian war until now, but it is now our duty to free Tuscany. The duke of Lucca has fled to our court begging our support in the war which he has lost for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL16.T;Savoy enters the arena;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL16.D;The duke of Savoy, angered by the reunion of Lucca to our duchy has entered the Italian war, promising to make us leave Italy forever;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
VAL17.T;The end of the Valois ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
VAL17.D;Provence has lived long enough. At least it's what the Dual-Monarchy thinks. Diplomatically isolated since the decaying of Aragon, this little state which still defies the Plantagenet will be crushed. For St-Denis and St-Georges, let us end the Hundred Years War forever !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE1.T;Greek Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE1.D;Venice's hold of Greece has been tedious since the beginning of the occupation during the Ottoman collapse. With the liberal movement gaining weight at home, the Greek nationalists have become more audacious over time. They reclaim an assembly of all Greeks to decide their future in the Republic. If this council is not held, this could lead to the rise of a rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE2.T;Opening of the Council of Athens;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE2.D;The Greek council finally opens in Athens, the magnificent city of Ancient Greece. Three great factions have formed over the previous months : the Zimisceses, followers of the general who helped Venice "protect" Greece 20 years ago, who want to establish an independent Greek state, the Exarchates, who want to acquire more autonomy, and the Pireans or "Italians", loyalists of Venice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE3.T;The result of the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE3.D;It is finally the end of the Council, what will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE4.T;The Council of Athens : Zimisceses' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE4.D;The Zimisceses have won the majority of the votes during the Council. Zimisces has profited from the occasion to declare the independence of Greece, and has rallied most of the Greek soldiers around him;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE5.T;The Council of Athens : Exarchates' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE5.D;The Exarchates have won the majority of the votes during the Council. They now ask for autonomy under the protection of Venice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x    
GRE6.T;Failure of the Exarchates' proposition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE6.D;Venice refusing Home Rule for the Greeks has led the Exarchates to rally with the Zimisceses and to proclaim the independence of Greece. Most of continental Greece is already in their control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE7.T;The Council of Athens : Pireans' Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE7.D;Unexpectedly, the Venetians loyalists won the majority of the vote during the Council. They are ready to stay under the government of Venice but only if Venice reforms itself and give the same political rights to Greeks as the Italians;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE8.T;Pireans failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE8.D;Venice has refused the chart proposed by the Loyalists. It has discredited them and most of the Greek representatives have rallied around Zimisces. Nearly all of continental Greece is now under their control;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE9.T;Council of Athens : No majority;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE9.D;No majority has emerged from the Council. Angered by the indecision of the politicians, the Greek general and war hero Zimisces has rallied his supportes in Thessalia and Attica and is determined to deliver Greece from the Italian oppressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE10.T;Fight for Freedom !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE17.D;The Cypriots have proclaimed the island of Cyprus to be a full part of Greece !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE18.T;The treaty of Corfu;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE18.D;The war with Greece has been lost. Guaranteed by Aragon and Bohemia, Zimisces has forces the signature of an humiliating treaty on the island of Corfu. Greece will be independent and Venice will free the territories under its control and relinquish any claims on Greek territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE19.T;The Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE19.D;Greece has won its independence by the treaty of Corfu, but now a new problem arises. Zimisces has had all powers during the revolution but not everybody is ready to agree with it. A new Greek council has been called in Delphi to settle the question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE20.T;Greek Rebellion Crushed !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
GRE20.D;Venice has reclaimed all rebels' territory ! Zimisces has been arrested and executed in the city of Athens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE29.T;A new council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE29.D;Greece has won its independence, but now a new problem arises. Zimisces has had all powers during the revolution but not everybody is ready to agree with it. A new Greek council has been called in Delphi to settle the question;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE30.T;Zimisces' rebels !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE30.D;After the interdiction of the council of Athens, Greek nationalists have radicalized. They founded the secret society of Filiki Eteria and recruited new members all over the Greek territory. They rose led by the general and war hero Zimisces who has proclaimed the independence of a new Greek state !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE31.T;Pireans' Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE31.D;Cyprus has chosen to stay under Venice dominion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE40.T;Opening of the Delphi Council ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE40.D;A new council is held in Greece. This time, the Greek representatives have assembled to discuss the draft of a constitution and there are already different factions opposing each other. First the Zimisceses, who defend a strong monarchy under Zimisces, the war hero and current leader of the state. There is also the Alexandros faction, who support the election of the king of Macedonia to the Greek throne but with more restrictions on the power of monarch. Finally the Pericles faction which wants to institute a real Republic. No matter what the result will be, the shadow of Zimisces is always present and he could try to take power for himself;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
GRE41.T;Opening of the Delphi Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE41.D;It is the end of the Delphi Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE42.T;Delphi Council : Zimisceses resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE42.D;The Greek representatives have decided to give the power to the current leader Konstantinos Zimisces, who will be crowned king of the Hellens. An assembly will be called, and political liberties are guaranteed but the king retains much of the power;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE43.T;Delphi Council : Alexandros resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE43.D;The Greek representatives have chosen to unite with Macedonia. But it will be at the coast of many political reforms asked by the liberals. Moreover Zimisces seems to be ready to launch a coup to claim power. What will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE44.T;The crown of Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE44.D;The Supporters of the Macedonian king have succeeded during the council of Athens. But they are saying that in exchange of the crown, the monarch will have to rescind its power and give a democratic assembly to the people and stop the multicultural policy started in Macedonia. That's the cost for allying the liberals to the idea. But we could enter Greece by force and take Athens to force them to bow to our conditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE45.T;The Macedonian attack !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE45.D;The king of Macedonia has refused the reforms of the liberals and is determined to take Greece under its conditions. To face him, the assembly has elected Zimisces king of the Greeks and hope that he can force him out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE46.T;Zimisces Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE46.D;Zimisces has seized the power despite the choice of our king in the council. We must march on Athens and take what is ours from this upstart general !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE47.T;Macedonian Victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE47.D;We have taken the city of Athens and captured Zimisces. He has been promptly executed and the Greek government has proclaimed the end of the war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE48.T;Zimisces Rebellion !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE48.D;Since the union of Greece and Macedonia, Zimisces has been plotting against the new monarch hoping to seize power in its place. Large tracts of Greece have risen in favor of Zimisces. We must crush him !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE49.T;Zimisces victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE49.D;Macedonia is utterly vainquished and the king has already fled to Aragon. Long live Zimisces !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE50.T;Council of Delphi : Pericles' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE50.D; The Council of Delphi has led to the establishment of a new Hellen Democracy. Let us hope that the Republic will bring us to glory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE51.T;Coup d'Etat !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE51.D;Zimisces has been plotting since the establishment of the Republic to gain power. Today he has entered Athens and asked the military to help him end the political squabbles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE52.T;Council of Delphi : Zimisces Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
GRE52.D;Seeing that no majority emerged from the Council, Zimisces took action and seized power. He must now face both the anger of the Macedonians and the democrats !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAV1.T;Basque Independence ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV1.D;Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan : The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon. Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using both kingdoms against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French allies to help him. What will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV2.T;A call from Pampelune;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV2.D;The king of Navarra has asked us to help him in his independence's inclination. Aragon might be decaying but it is still not dead. Henry IV awaits an answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV3.T;Independence of Navarre !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV3.D;With the backing of the Anglo-French, Navarre has proclaimed its independence.

NAV4.T;Reaction from Barcelona;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV4.D;Navarre has proclaimed its independence ! They have expelled our representatives with the support of the Dual-Monarchy. We could always intervene militarily and annex this kingdom we have coveted for centuries. But if we do so, we will have to face the Dual-Monarchy ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NAV5.T;A new ally ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAV10.D;The Bourbon dynasty has seen fewer and fewer male members born these last years. The last true Bourbon, descendant of Hugh Capet has died in Pampeluna yesterday. He leaves two possible heirs : his sister the countess of St-Sebastian married into the Aragonese family and the infante of Bilbao his illegimate daughter married to the Dauphin. The Navarran Estates have gathered to choose who will succeed to Henry and thus in which country Navarra will be tied with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

NAV13.D;The king of Aragon has decided to push the claims of the countess of St-Sebastian to the throne of Navarra. Even if it just concerns Navarra, we should send an ultimatum to Aragon demanding them to back down and acknowledge the infante as the rightful queen !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

athesia_purchase_desc; The Venetian colony of Athesia is located on a major strategic point.

habana_purchase_title; The Habanan purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
habana_purchase_desc; With our control over Athesia established, it is time to turn our eyes south. The island of Habana is the only colony that did not join Gran Colombia during the war of independence. It is one of the last Spanish holdings in the New World and it holds a strategic position. To be free from any intervention or disruption of commerce in the Gulf of Mexico, we must control the island. It will require however a large amount of cash and even that will not bind Spain to give Habana...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ayiti_purchase_title; The Sudurhafeyjar Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

dissolve_CLM_desc;This war has shown us something. The former Spanish colonies united under the same flag are a threat to our influence in Arcadia and Ameriga. Some in our government have suggested that we make Gran Colombia dissolve itself in little states easier to control and manipulate. Thus there will only be one power in the New-World, us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA1.T;The Anglois Dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA1.D;Ever since the Treaty of Rome in 1498, the Dual Monarchy has had to walk a fine line in not favouring one of its ethnic groups over the others. Recent censi have shown that the English and French represent around one-fifth of the population. What is more threatening to either group is not the other but rather a growing group calling themselves Anglois. These groups have created the dilemma for the monarchy in who to favor. There are those in power that believe that it is best to pick a side while others believe that the Anglois ideology of blending the best customs of English and French is the way of the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA2.T;The Death of King Henri X;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA2.D;Tragedy has struck the Dual Monarchy as His Majesty King Henri X has passed with no heir. Due to traditional laws within the Dual Monarchy, the Estates-General has been called to select their choice for the next ruler of the Kingdom. The Estates have narrowed the selection between Elisabeth, Duchess of Anjou, Edouard, the Duke of York, and Henri, the Duke of Gascony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA3.T;Coronation of Elisabeth I;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA3.D;Despite some opposition votes the Estates-General has declared that Elisabeth will be the next Queen of the Dual Monarchy. Being the daughter of the King's brother gave her the strongest claim to the throne but her pro-Anglois ties has led to some opposition from those in France and England. Both Edouard and Henri have respected the Estates decision and pledged their support to Elisabeth in the future of the Dual Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA4.T;Coronation of Edouard X;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA4.D;It took the Estates-General some rounds of voting but they have settled on Edouard, the Duke of York, as the next King of the Dual Monarchy. England has received the news with great joy while France is worried of potential retribution by the new king for past injustices. Elisabeth and Henri have renounced the throne but Henri vows that he will participate in the Parliament of Lords in preventing bias legislation by the King from being passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA5.T;Coronation of Henri XI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA5.D;To the shock of many Henri, the Duke of Gascony, has been elected the next King of the Dual Monarchy. His election as King has been recieved with joy in the southern regions of the country but outrage has broken out in England. Elisabeth and Edouard has both renounced the throne but Edouard expressed his great displeasure with the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

We need to contact a Great Power to counter the threat from Paris : Scandinavia has a good navy and shares a border in Scotland; Burgundy will surely dominate on the Continent, Aragon can easily pierce through Occitania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA8.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA8.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have revolted against the Dual-Monarchy and are asking to protect them from the Anglois. Such a move will lead to war against Paris but it is a golden opportunity to weaken the Plantagenets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA9.T;A new Hastings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA9.D;The English will face our might !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA10.T;The French Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA10.D;After the questions of the last years, the monarchy has affirmed its French character. Rooted in Paris, the monarchy has gained the support of the French population and of its leaders. This French orientation has allowed them to suppress any rebellion in the South but in the same time has alienated them a great part of the English population...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA11.T;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA11.D;The radicalization of the English society has increased over the past few months. The French turnout of Henri X has alienated him many Englishmen, who were eager to support the monarchy have turned to the liberal hydra. Yesterday the repression of a student manifestation in Cambridge has launched a spiral of violence all over England. It has culminated in the creation of the English Republic which is decided to push “the French out of England”. Apart from some loyalists bastion in Wales and Londres, the revolutionaries are already in control of most the island. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA12.T;St-Louis Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA12.D;The king of the Dual-Monarchy has organised a great ceremony throughout the cities of France to honour his ancestor Louis XI king of France later sanctified as “Saint Louis”. He has put the accent on the treaty of Paris who settled peace between the Plantagenets and the Capetians. In a speech pronounced in the capital by Henri X affirming the French character of the monarchy who always has never forgotten its French roots. While praised on the continent, the speech has been criticized by many in England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA13.T;The great travel of Henri;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA13.D;To further enhance his presence, Henri X decided to travel amongst France. He first visited Normandie where he praised his ancestor Guillaume who embarked to conquer England. He then turned to Brittany, a land attached to the Plantegenian monarchs. His travel led him then to La Rochelle. There he met several of the “Young French” leaders who spontaneously rallied to him and praised his signs in favour of France. He then travelled south passing through Gascony, Toulouse. He then made a stop in Vichy to remember the last great battle against the Valois before returning to the capital. Many people are acclaiming the king for this action that has strengthened the hold of the monarchy in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA14.T;The Sons of Harold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA14.D;Lately a wave of contests have risen in England towards the French turn-around of Henri X. The English people have been indeed absent from the speeches of Henri and many are looking to alternatives. A certain John Tolsmith, professor in Cambridge, lately published a monumental history of England before the Norman Conquest. His book has become incredibly popular amongst the English students who have created an association to valorise their “English inheritance” called the “sons of Harold”, in reference to Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king. While this may only be a cultural association, many of its members are prone to radical ideas and it is said that the slogan of “Freiheit, Gleicheit, Brüderlichkeit” are murmured in these circles … ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA15.T;Spread of the Sons of Harold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA15.D;The sons of Harold have implemented themselves in this province and are already spreading their ideas ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA16.T;"L'anglais est-il est une langue ?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA16.D;A dispute has emerged in the Sorbonne between two scholars to determine if English can be considered as a true language worthy of being spoken in the high spheres such as the government. While it can be seen as just a philological debate, we could influence the result in one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA17.T;A new minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA17.D;Sadly our prime minister has died in office. It falls upon the monarch to choose a new prime minister. Three candidates have the favour of the Parliament : the duke of Richelieu, known for his inclination for the Young French, the duke of Rohan, the Breton moderate and lastly the duke of Devonshire, well-known in the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA18.T;The Shakespeare festival;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA18.D;The English have organised a festival in Stratford upon Avon to honour a play-writer called William Shakespeare. Rediscovered by the sons of Harold, this unknown author has written many tragicomedies in English, which criticize heavily the Parisian Monarchy while praising English historical figures like his life of Alfred the Great in 4 plays. This festival could become a centre of protestation especially if they represent Henry VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA19.T;The death of the Prince of Wales;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA19.D;While visiting England, the Prince of Wales and his entourage were attacked by radicals in the city of Liverpool. It resulted in the death of Henry, the heir of the Dual-Monarchy, his pregnant wife and his son. The attack made with an artisanal weaponry, that many call "the Infernal Machine", was imagined by students affiliated to the Sons of Harold. While Tolsmith has denied any implication of his organisation and vigorously condemned the attack, the king is persuaded of his implication and is determined in his grief to shut the the organisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA21.T;The English Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA21.D;Despite the troubles of the past years the monarchy has asserted its English roots. With London and Paris weighing the same in political matters the monarchy has gained the support of the English population!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA22.T;The Midi Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA22.D;The English backlash of Henry X has alienated the Southern French lands. The local Occitans have always been more rebellious because of their protestant roots and also because of their support for the Valois kings. The Revolt supported by the Sons of St-Louis has gained the control of most Occitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA23.T;Choosing the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA23.D;The Occitan state must now choose what form of government it shall be : will they welcome the Valois pretender or proclaim a free Republic ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA24.T;The March on Toulouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA24.D;The rebellious Occitan have acknowledged the Valois as the true Kings of France and pledged their loyalty to the reconquest of the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA25.T;The new Hundred Years War;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA25.D;Provence has taken control of our rebellious provinces and has pledged to not stop until Paris! We can't let them do this and must put an end to the War for the French Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA26.T;The Counter-revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA26.D;Occitania has affirmed as an independent Republic! We can't let them do such a thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA27.T;Creation of the Sons of St-Louis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA27.D;A french nationalist organisation has been created yesterday in La Rochelle by a certain Francois Guizot, a university historian. The aim of this association is to strengthen the conscience of the French and Provencal people and make them aware of their distinctness from the British. The name has been taken from Louis XI, a King who was later canonized and who he is seen as a fatherly figure of French history. It is particularly popular amongst the French students and many fear they might be spreading revolutionary ideals...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x  
DUA28.T;Spread of the Sons of St-Louis;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA28.D;The sons of St-Louis have implemented themselves in this province and are already spreading their ideas ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA29.T;The Great Royal Travel;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA29.D;To further enhance his presence, Henri X decided to travel amongst England. He first landed near Hastings where he praised his ancestor Guillaume who there managed to win the English crown. He then went to Londres where he visited the locals of the East Indian Company on the boards of the Tamise. His travel led him then to Cambridge and Ofxord. There he met several of the “Young English” leaders who spontaneously rallied to him and praised his signs in favour of England. He then travelled west and north passing through Wales and Livreport. He then made a stop in York to praise Richard Plantagenet, duke of York, one of the heroes of the early Dual-Monarchy. Many people are acclaiming the king for this action that has strengthened the hold of the monarchy in England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA30.T;Romanticism;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA30.D;A new school has appeared in arts. The Romanticists defy the laws established by the classical school of Paris and coming back to the roots of Baroque. It is especially successful in England. Tolsmith and Lord Byron are publishing poems taking their roots in the old Saxon mythology, Scnery is writing plays who are inspired by Shakespeare... This school has however little sucess amongst the literary critics of the capital who accuse them of recklessly crossing laws that were fixed by wise Elders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA40.T;The Anglois dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA40.D;Reconciling both French and English will not be an easy task, Henri X knows it very well. The two groups may not like each other but they hate Paris even more, so an alliance of both needs to be prevented. However one must not charge too much against one group unless one wants a local revolution to happen ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA41.T;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA42.T;Pacification of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA42.D;Despite the peril we managed to win against the revolutionaries, a fact that has strengthened our hold on all our territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA43.T;Independence of England;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA43.D;The English nationalists have secured their independence. We can't succeed in our current policy with them being independent;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA44.T;Pacification of the Midi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA44.D;The Southern parts of our kingdom have been secured ! Despite the rebellion we can continue our policy of accepting both French and English !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA45.T;Independent Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA45.D;The South has escaped from our power. With our mainland territories threatened we can't surely make our rule accepted in both England and France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA46.T;The Midi Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA47.T;The Franco-English Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA47.D;Revolters have swarmed the streets of the great cities of the Dual-Monarchy in a scale not seen since the First German Revolution ! The nationalist rebels are decided to end the monarchy in blood if necessary and with it the very idea of the Anglois dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA48.T;The Anglo-French monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA48.D;The Plantagenet throne has endured ! Despite the threat of radicals, nationalists and foreign power, all its people stands ready to serve their country ! The coming decades will surely be Anglois for who can stand against the combined force of the Dual-Monarchy of France and England ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA50.T;Choosing a Patron;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA50.D;The King has to choose an historical figure to honor in the coming months. Several proposals have emerged : Alfred the Great, the old Saxon king is admired by many across the Channel, Louis XI the Holy is seen as a benevolent figure here on the continent, Edouard IV was the first Plantagenet born in Paris and thus is seen as both a rallying figure for the Anglois but also a usurper for the French and a traitor for the English. No matter who the King chooses to honour it will not please everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA51.T;Liberal agitations;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA51.D;Liberals and Nationalists from both sides of the Channel have formed societies aimed at spreading their ideas. If we allow them, the Sons of Harold and Saint Louis will surely provoke problems in our territories but banishing them will provoke an even bigger reaction ...;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA52.T;'Histoire de la France depuis ses origines';;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA52.D;The historian Pierre Guizot has published a new book upon the history of France. The book has received a warm response from French scholars for its exhaustivity. But its portrayal of English and early Plantagenets is quite troublesome and his idea of "a distinct spirit existing since the Gauls' War" only amuses the French nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA53.T;Saxon poetry;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA53.D;An anthology of English poetry has been published in Cambridge by the Sons of Harold. Regrouping old and new poets alike, this book has become widely applaused in England but many scholars from Paris consider it a complete waste of time ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA54.T;Travel of the Dauphin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA54.D;Henry X is becoming unfit to travel outside of Paris. He now has to delegate this duty to his son Henry, Dauphin of France and Prince of Wales;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA55.T;A night in theatre ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA55.D;Paris is bursting with cultural creation. Theatres attract the crowds with 3 great pieces having a huge success. First the adaptation of Alfred the Great, the main work of the English author Shakespeare which combines epic and comic, in a way that pleases the Romanticists. Another troup is playing 'Le Malade Imaginaire' of Moliere, a French comic author that travelled the roads of Southern France. Eventually another adaptation of 'Joan the Mad', the tragedy of Racine is still very loved by the court. If one of the Royals would attend one of these spectacles it would surely be seen as a symbol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA56.T;Les Immortels;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA56.D;The Rotal Academy was founded in the XVIIth century to host the greatest literary minds of the whole kingdom and it has since evolved to also codify the official language from the monarchy. One of the Immortals' siege has been liberated and we have to nominate someone. Tolsmith despite being a Saxon is recognized as one of the greatest philologists from the kingdom. In Occitania the poet Jasmin has achieved in seducing the minds of the court. But the grammarian Morel could be nominated to show our will of uniformisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DUA57.T;Celebration of the German Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA57.D;Radicals in the Kingdom are preparing for the 55th anniversary of the First German Revolution. Some advisors have talked about allowing them to do so to better control them but if we do so then it will cost us our relations with the Bohemian court... Forbidding them to commemorate and organizing great ceremonies remembering the prowess of our armies during the ensuing wars would certainly be a good symbol of unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
DUA58.T;The Rebellions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DUA90.D;The Great Revolt is over : where the Plantagenets ruled, 4 new nations have arisen. The king has been executed by radicals in Paris and the members from the Royal Family who have survived, escaped to their New World haven of Plantagenia. The overseas territories have been snatched by the other Colonialist Powers and the 4 Sisters Republics of Ireland, England, France and Occitania have pledged to defend each other against the threat of the Counter-revolution. The Anglois dream of multiculturalism is dead and it seems that nationalism may threaten the old European order ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM1.D; Now we have defeated the rebels we have to decide how we shall administer this vast territory. Some are in favor of keeping the Colombians under our rule but it will cost us tremendous amounts of money to successfully rule the area. Most are proposing home rule. Some propose to reestablish the vice-royalties of Lusitania, Mexico and Granada along with the Capitancy-General of Greater Salvador. However we could also dislocate the Granadan territory between a colony around Cartagena, establishing a new Capitancy in Essequibo and giving the rest of Tierra Firme to a Castillian vice-royalty around Caracas. The Andes provinces would be divided between Arequipa and Quito and to avoid a strong Mexico we would separate Jalisco. The choice is the hands of the king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

And eventually a fringe minority calls for the complete annexation of Lotharingia to form a greater Amerigan Federation.

SS1.T;History of the Dual-Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS1.D;The execution of Joan of Arc would come to mark the beginning of the end for the French Wars of Succession (1337-1498), as the Armagnac Party would never again rise to what it once was. The Valois and their allies would fight on for another seventy years, but with the victory of Edward the Red Prince at Vichy the future of a Dual Monarchy of France and England was secured, only being confirmed with the 1498 Treaty of Rome. The threat of encirclement with the Marriage of Anne of Brittany with Jean III of Burgundy, led to the breakdown of the Anglo-Burgundian alliance in 1490 when, unable to challenge the marriage, invaded Brittany during the Anglo-Franco-Breton War (1490-1492). Burgundy, unable to provide support against France due to rebellion fermented by the House of Lorraine, forced Brittany's surrender. While it was too late to annul the marriage, with Jean having consummated it, the Treaty of Le Verger effectively saw Brittany annexed into the French crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS2.D;The Reformation presented new challenges to the unity of the thrones. The deep involvement of the Valois in aiding Zwingli's escape from Papal and Imperial imprisonment was too good a pretext to end any alternate succession, causing the Languedoc War (1532), and ending with the conquest of Languedoc & Auvergne, leaving only a rump Provencal state in the Azure Coast and in Rhone. In addition to the affairs of Provence, it also engaged in what became known as the Great Game with the Kingdom of Burgundy and the Crown of Aragon. The subject of these wars of influence came about with Navarre (which saw the conquest of the County of Foix & Bearn in 1516), the Italian Peninsula (which ended largely as a victory for the Aragonese, as most of the Peninsula, save Savoy, Genoa, Milan, and the Emilian Dukedoms fell under their influence, compared to only Savoy for the Dual Monarchy), and even the County of Provence (which easily fell into the Aragonese camp to save them from being destroyed by the Plantagenets.);;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS3.D;While aggressively fighting heresy abroad the Kings of Both Thrones were initially tolerant of Protestants. King Francois I was torn between dynastic links to the firmly Catholic Jagiellons of Bohemia and a large portion of his populace firm in their new faith. Further strife in England and in Aquitaine combined with the growing threat of Burgundy (long the champion of the Protestant cause) tipped the balance leading first to the Anglo-French Wars of Religion (1598-1614) both within the Kingdom and among its neighbors, and later after the defeat of the Protestants, the Exodus of the Protestant Huguenots to Burgundy, Scandinavia and Colonial New Burgundy (now the Seven Republics) and the Anglican Father Pilgrim and their followers to what they would call New England (now Beornia).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS4.D;While England was briefly a viceroyalty under the Dukes of Gloucester, the throne would be forever undivided following the dissolution of the English Parliament by Henry VII in 1537, and its merging into the Estates General. The nobility with the exception of some distant provinces converged increasingly to Paris as French, became the official language throughout both kingdoms. This led to the gradual Francification of England as once English names were increasingly replaced by French. By the turn of the 19th century, French has become the primary common language in the Southern parts of England. The concept of a centralized Parliamentary body was revolutionary for its time, and, almost ironically, would influence the future legislative bodies of the Burgundian Estates-General, the Savoyard Subalpine Senate, the Aragonese Cortes and the Scandinavian Riksdag, among other European states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS5.D;The Anglo-French history in Ireland was also something of a peculiar moment. During the French Wars of Succession, English, and later Anglo-French control of the Island was left in the hands of the House of Fitzgerald, the Earls of Kildare as much time was spent in building a new administrative apparatus for both England and France. Because of this, the Kildares, along with the House of Desmond, both began to rule Ireland as if it was their own Kingdom. The issues, which had been building up during the twilight years of the reign of Henri VIII culminated in the three Irish Wars (1573-1579, 1583-1594 and the Nine Years’ War, 1598-1607). Which gradually saw Ireland pacified, the rebel Irish Lords killed and the King of England and France reaffirmed as Lord of Ireland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS6.D;With the unexpected ascension of James IV of Scotland to the Throne of the North in 1500 the Plantagenêts faced the threat of encirclement by the alliance of Burgundy and the former. The exodus of the early 17th century was compounded by wars against Burgundy and Scandinavia pushing emigration to the colonies of Plantagenia and Amazonie. However the pushing towards these colonies were not without strife there as well, as conflicts were rife between Colonial Vinland and New Burgundy, as well as against the Cherokee and Creek, among other First Nation Tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS7.D;Eventually, the Dual Monarchy secured its position as the unquestioned power in Western Europe amid the gradual decline of Spain. A period of relative peace in Europe allowed the Dual Monarchy to expand its influences abroad. The Dual Monarchy established trading posts along the coast of Sierra Lionne, allowed them to trade European goods for slaves to be sent to the New World. A series of wars with the Kingdom of Kandy (1696-1703, 1705-1715, 1716-1717) saw the entirety of Ceylon becoming an Anglo-French crown colony, allowing access to the Indian Ocean Trade through good relations with the Nasirid Sultans of Bengal. At the same time there was a great degree of expansion in the Anglo-French colonies in the New World, as colonial conflicts with Scandinavia, Burgundy and Spain, reinforced its mother country’s position. This period of colonial expansion was broken with the War of the Anglo-French Succession, leading to the independence of Plantagenia under a cadet branch of the House of Plantagenêt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS8.D;Remaining largely aloof during the opening stages of the Great German Wars allowed the industrial revolution to take hold and the Dual Monarchy seemed set to dominate this new realm as well. But the battles of the later war quickly demonstrated that the old rival Burgundy was again on the rise as even beaten and battered it remained victorious, losing only its other colony Amazonie to independence. The Dual Monarchy enters the middle of the 19th century as the ultimate global power, but for the first time in over a century its position does not appear unassailable in Anvers and courts beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS10.T;History of Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS10.D;Following the Congress of Arras, Philip of Burgundy swore fealty to Henry VI but extracted a high price. While still obligated to come to his liege's aid in time of war Philip secured for himself and his heirs full exemption from taxation and full command of his own vassals and levies. Hence began Burgundy's rise to true independence. English actions over the following decades continued to jeopardize the relationship as Burgundy felt it bore a disproportionate cost in the war, while the English took its aid for granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS11.D;With the death of Philip, his son Charles would pursue an aggressive and independent policy greatly expanding his realm earning him the epithet "the Bold". Through campaigns across southern France and up and down the Rhine, by his death he would secure the addition of the entirety of the Low Countries, Alsace, Lorraine, and the northern Rhine including Cologne, Trier, Mainz, and the Palatinate, as well as the crown and title Rex Burgundicum. While much of the realm remained officially in the Empire or in fief to France, never again would a Burgundian bow to Paris or Prague. To secure this new throne the Burgundians began to quietly back their distant relatives the Valois against their former lieges the Plantagenets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS12.D;Zwingli proved popular in much of the realm and the kingdom welcomed a stream of refugees as the Dual Monarchy dismantled much of the Valois’ remnants in the Languedoc War (1532). The burning of Zwingli at the stake in 1527 sent Burgundy firmly down the path of Protestantism as it confronted its newly confirmed enemies the Jagiellons and Plantagenets. The accession of Philippe IV to the Burgundian throne in 1528 saw ties to the former Duchy are cut as he moved the capital from Dijon to Anvers in the Low Countries. The new King also began pursuing a policy of aggressive defense of Protestantism in the Empire, becoming its champion with support from the Stuarts of Scandinavia. Explicitly ignoring the Treaty of Pamplona, Burgundian settlements are established in both Ameriga and Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS13.D;The Wars of Religion begin to kick off in earnest amid Burgundy's new policy of supporting any Protestant monarch in defense of his throne (often interpreted where convenient to include lesser claimants). While maintaining a level of civility with the Dual Monarchy, Burgundy pursues a series of proxy wars in northwestern Italy which, although lost, serve to further confirm Burgundian supremacy in arms if not local politics. Open warfare against the Emperors in Central Germany made Burgundy the recognized leader of the central German Protestants while her close ally Scandinavia dominated in the north. Caught between the Turks and Protestants, Bohemia and her allies slowly lost ground on both fronts in a series of wars through the 16th and early 17th century, much to Burgundy's benefit. Burgundy's armies exhausted by decades of constant fighting began to give way, and despite the inability to dominate Germany, they were able to secure religious freedom and thus, they hoped, a long peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS14.D;The enrichment of the Dutch and Flemish merchant houses through loans to the government and monopolies on Atlantic trade brought great benefits. It financed unparalleled technological development at home and led to the first trade ventures east securing the first Burgundian footholds in the Indian Ocean. With several decades of peace Burgundy looked inward for the most part though trade ventures secured footholds on the Cape and in Southeast Asia. Increasingly overshadowed by her neighbor the Dual Monarchy, Burgundy sought to shore up her support in the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS15.D;The unexpected events of the Revolution in Frankfurt forced Burgundy into the unusual position of backing the Emperor in his crackdown as the rebels turned on the aristocracy at large. But as the Catholic League showed its intent to abuse the support to secure its position, Burgundy started the defining war of the time, the Great German War (1796-1820). As armies marched across the Empire new states rose and fell through the decades as the unprecedented bloodshed continued and all Europe was drawn in. Nationalism's dread rise threatened the integrity of Burgundy as a state, but ultimately it emerged victorious above the other European powers with its territory intact at the head of a new alliance of western Imperial states set to march proudly into the 19th century.?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS20.T;History of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS20.D;Spanish Colonization of the Americas did not begin in earnest until the accession of Alfonso XII, when the first outpost would be established in 1496 in the Island of Cuba, named Santiago after the Mythological Saint James the Moor-slayer. By the end of the first quarter of the 16th century, the Spanish had already established a series of colonial holdings in Cuba. The first expedition into the mainland of the New World came in 1517, when Cuban governor Diego Velázquez commissioned a small Spanish fleet to explore the Yucatan Peninsula (the future Captaincy General of Mayapan), led by Hernández de Cordóba. There they would meet the local natives of the Mayan city of Cape Catoche.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SS21.D;The Spaniards read to them the Requirement of 1513 to them, which offered the natives the protection under the King of Spain should they submit to them. However they were refused and caused a great incident to occur, which saw many a Spaniard killed or forced to flee. Two years later a second attempt to explore the mainland came in 1519, this time it was a larger force that landed in Central Mexico. This force would find themselves allied with various natives, in what the latter saw was a great opportunity to overthrow the oppressive and brutal Aztec Triple Alliance. The Spanish Conquistador force, led by Hernan Cortes, would join with various Mesoamerican tribes such as the Tarascans and the Tlaxcalans in battle, defeating the Aztecs in Otumba and sacking the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, razing it to the ground and building a new capital, Mexico City, which would become the seat of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS22.D;From the conquest and subjugation of the Aztecs followed further conquests, first of former allies in Mesoamerica, then of the Mayans, who of which resisted for much of the 16th century, despite being largely under Spanish control by the late 1520’s, and even down into what would be Granada. Ultimately, they would be stopped by two formidable forces. To the south was the Empire of Tawantinsuyu, whom, despite having to deal with a Civil War, was able to repulse and humiliate the Spaniards, a feat further strained due to official support from the Dong Guo City-States as well as the Dual Monarchy of England-France. Attempts at expansion northwards was also met with dismal failure, first by the Dong-Guo City States, who humiliated the Spanish at the Battle of Yongle in 1544, and was further reined in by the Anglo-French encroachment deeper into the Arcadian continent as the Viceroyalty of Plantagenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS23.D;Colonial life saw Gran Colombian society divided into a series of castes. At the top were the Peninsulares, the peoples born in Spain.. Under them were the Criollos, citizens born in the colonies to full Peninsularies and Creole families. Between the two were the colonial government dominated by, with respect to the King of Spain. Below them are the Mestizos and Mulattos, who are citizens of mixed Spanish and Native American/African ancestry, and finally at the bottom are the Native peoples and African slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS24.D;The Viceroyalty was originally established with control over the entire territory from Lusitania to Cusco. This would change with the Beja Reforms instituted in the late 18th century during the reign of King Manuel and King Jose. These reforms saw an attempt to centralize the Spanish Empire to the person of the Absolutist King of Spain. This included partitioning the Viceroyalty of New Spain into four, Lusitania in the North, San Salvador in Mesoamerica, Granada in Ameriga, and a rump Viceroyalty of New Spain in control of Mexico and Cuba. The government would be ruled exclusively by peninsulaires, who in theory would be disinterested, these peninsulaires being military men who had long records of military service. Clergymen, audencia judges and governor-generals were also staffed by peninsulaires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS25.D;This disenfranchisement by the King, coupled with economic forms working against the colonials, among other issues led to ideas of independence and self-government to spread. The tip off was the renegade priest Miguel Hidalgo’s Cry of Dolores speech, which would kick off what would eventually become the Spanish American Wars of Independence or the Spanish-Colombian War (1815, 1818- ) The conflict brought many peoples together in attempting to remove the Spanish, culminating in the founding of the Colombian Alliance in 1819 under Mexican General Vicente Guerrero. Over the course of the three year campaign, the revolutionaries were able to successfully liberate Mexico (the Second Mexican Republic, the First having been crushed immediately after its founding in 1815), and Lusitania (The Lusitanian Republic) before being decisively defeated in the Battle of San Salvador on 16 September 1822, ultimately leading to the first armistice, signed in Veracruz at the end of the month.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS26.D;Meanwhile in Ameriga, a group of revolutionaries seized control of the New Granadan Viceregal capital of Cartagena, and declared the creation of the Republic of Granada (the precursor to Santandera). Led by Simon Bolivar, the new Republic began its own waves of conquest, incorporated the Governor-Generalate of Quito and Arequipa in the Andes. This coupled with the restarting of the Mexican advance into Guatemala, saw the rebirth of the Colombian Alliance, now with the Amerigan Republics added to this group. By the end of 1828, the Spanish were now reduced to their holdings in Cuba, Nueva Castilla & Essequibo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS27.D;Desperate, the colonial governor of Granada called upon the support of the Inca under their leader, Huayna Capac IV. This Inca Intervention (1829-1832), initially tipped the battle in Spain’s favor, as Peru was coming under siege. But they were decisively defeated as Lima, seeing the death of Simon Bolivar as a result. The Inca continued their conflict under the new Colombian Supreme Leader, and Bolivar’s protege, Francisco de Paula Santander, but the latter’s death upon the removal of the Inca from Peru saw the Alliance become centralized and dominated by Granadan general Francisco de Miranda. However, to reassure the peoples of Mexico, Lusitania and Mesoamerica, Miranda established a Tetrarchy, bringing in Juan Manuel Santos to represent Mesoamerica, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to represent Mexico and Manuel Luis de Madeira to represent Lusitania, however Santa Anna would still hold the most power out of the four members.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS28.D;Under the coalition of Miranda and Santos in 1832, Gran Colombia launched a full-scale assault on Castilla and Essequibo, successfully removing Spanish presence there by 1834. Miranda, now determined to remove the Spanish completely from the Americas, began construction of a Navy, utilized all the naval shipyards the alliance had to offer. This hastily assembled fleet was to carry their army to conquer Cuba, but this move was intercepted by a Large Spanish fleet that had recently arrived at port in Havana. The Battle of Havana, fought on 21 April 1835, was the decisive battle that saw the Colombian Navy smashed and half it’s men going down with their ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS29.D;The battle would be followed up by summer with a massive invasion against the Colombian rebels, seeing Lusitania, the Yucatan and Granada being invaded by the Spanish in a determined effort to end the Colombian independence movement. Miranda, either to better coordinate the alliance, or out of strengthening his power, abolished the republics and united them into a Federal Republic centralized in Mexico City.Despite being corrupted by a power-hungry general, the dream of Independence for the Spanish-speaking peoples of the New World still lingers for those who wish to fight for it. But do the people wish to fight for their freedom, or would they wish to once again be forced under the yoke of Spanish domination??;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS30.T;History of Qingqiu;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS30.D;The Origin of Qingqiu (Chinese for Clear Autumn) can be traced back to the voyages of Zheng He that was sponsored by the Yongle (1404-1424) and Hongxi (1424-1435) Emperors of Ming China, all of which highlighted the power of the Scholar-Bureaucratic Faction over the Eunuchs. Zheng He would be tasked by the Xuande Emperor to launch an expedition to explore further east after the successful fifth expedition leading to the discovery of Zhourao (OTL Australia). As such in 1430, the expedition would set sail. The journey, which took roughly eight months to achieve, would come to an end when they landed in what would later become known as Sanbao Bay.After leaving some of the peoples there behind, Zheng He would make a return trip to China to report his findings, leaving Lei Shoushan and several troops behind to settle and live in this new world. A second voyage would occur in 1433-1434, bringing more soldiers, but also farmers and miners to Qingqiu.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS31.D;During the trek there, Zheng He decided that something dramatic needed to be done to appease the unhappy passengers to avoid some kind of disaster. He arranged for the fleet to stop and allow people to visit ships other than their own, in an attempt to abate their cabin fever. These became regular events, almost celebrations; typically, the same ships would cluster together each time, forming communities that sustained people through the ordeal of being stuck in ships for months. As a result, when the Chinese made landfall in Sanbao Bay, and with plans for a large expansion inland, it was decided the communities that were formed by the ship clusters would be sent across the coast, forming new cities such as Yongle (named after the Emperor who supported the treasure fleets), Xiazhou & Julinyutan, with the original site of their first departure being named Sanbao, after Zheng He, who would die shortly after the second voyage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS32.D;About two years after the Second Landing, more ships arrived from China. They carried no passengers, however – in fact, they carried barely any soldiers. They had come to deliver a message: the Hongxi Emperor had died and his son now ruled as the Xuande Emperor. The new emperor was uninterested in continuing to devote so many financial and military resources to such a distant colony, and ordered the troops to return. His Majesty had disavowed any interest in Qingqiu, and declared that anyone who remained there would no longer be under his protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS33.D;This caused an uproar in Sanbao, and Lei Shoushan, now leader of the city, sent messages to the other Dong Guo City States, instead of discussing the order of returning to China, instead to demand they swear fealty to him, as the new Emperor of Dong Guo. But neither the other cities, nor even Sanbao, wanted an Emperor, and before any ceremony took place, a coup occurred in Sanbao, killing Lei and forcing the Ming messenger to leave, the latter convinced that their time living in the wilderness had driven them into lunacy. The city-states would come under the administration of the military governors until the 1470’s and 1480’s, when wealthy and influential men took the reigns in power, forming City Councils, with a representative from each city forming what would ultimately become the Council of Twenty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS34.D;During the late 15th century, Dongese explorers sailed south beyond the lands of Mexico and discovered Twanitsuyu. These explorers would meet with and establish a long-standing trade network with the Incan people, bringing untold wealth to the city-states (most especially the southern-most city Yongle) in exchange for weaponry and arms to the Inca. These proved instrumental in the Inca Civil War (1529-1532) and the subsequent Spanish-Incan War (1532-1537), where the Incans, supported by the Dongese, defeated the Spanish. Spanish attempts to subjugate the city-states directly led to the former’s defeat at the Battle of Yongle, forcing Spain to accept the borders between the city states and New Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS35.D;Although Qingqiu was safe from any invasion by the sheer expanse of the continent, the powers of Europe viewed the city-states as weak and quizzically outdated. The relationship quickly shifted from trading partners to one of a more exploitative nature. Wealthy businessmen from the colonies were able to buy considerable influence in the courts of individual cities. The period from 1709 to 1762 (often called the Bloody Age) saw Qingqiu mired in conflict as cities were convinced to go to war with each other to benefit easterners thousands of miles away. A company in New Burgundy might convince one city to blockade another favored by Scandinavian merchants, leading the two to go to war while the company profited from the fallout. A Plantegenian aristocrat might arrange for one city state to raid another and pay for “laborers” taken from the captives.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS36.D;By the latter half of the 18th century, the people of Qingqiu were exhausted. The endless, pointless wars had taken their toll and many simply refused the call to arms. Sanbao, and especially Yongle, had been strong enough to resist most outside influence. In 1760 a coalition of European corporations attempted to rally the northern city states to force their interests on the two southern strong-holds. Sanbao and Yongle formed an alliance, defeating several of their neighbors in battle and encouraging rebellions in the farther cities. In the end, the corrupted leaders were deposed, and the city-states signed the treaty of the Brother’s Peace; never again would the people of Qingqiu take arms against one another at the behest of a foreign power.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS37.D;It is often said that this marks the beginning of a unified Qingqiu. However, conservative elements in the victorious cities wanted to preserve the city-state system. Thus, the settlements remained independent, though in the wake of the Bloody Age the populace began to see a common identity linking them to their neighbors.During the Great German War (1795-1820) and the various Wars of Independence fought across the Western Hemisphere, the Qingquiren people were shocked at the developments of which the nations were becoming independent, even more disconcerting when their direct neighbor to the south, Mexico declared its independence from Spain. Lan Weisheng, a Qingquiren educated in the Western way saw these movements as a reason for the Dongese city states to unite into one united state.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS38.D;While the move was supported by Sanbao (at the time ruled by Weisheng’s father, Lan Biao), Yongle and other city states in the south, it was hotly opposed by the Council of Twenty and the Northern city states, thus leading to what would lead to a brief, bloodless conflict (1811-1812) which ultimately saw the Northern City-States frightened into union due to the increasing encroachment of Vinlandic settlers westward, and the Council of Twenty dissolved in favor of a Federalized government loyal to Sanbao.As the Dongese Cities, now centralized into the Qingqiu Federation, marches forward into the 19th century, one must come to wonder what the future would hold for them. But for those brave sons of Zheng He’s legacy, they hope that they will march for and lead in this brave new world...?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS40.T;History of Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS40.D;The end of the Hussite Wars (1419-1434) left Bohemia in ruins. Albert von Habsburg died a year after his coronation in 1438 and the kingdom was inherited by his son Ladislas Postumus. One of the Hussite Bohemian nobles George von Podiebrad gathered an army and took the capital by power and declared himself the Lord Regent. Catholic nobles rose against him and a civil war broke out but George swiftly won. Ladislas was elected in 1453 but died four years after. George was elected as the king. After a long series of negotiating he reached an agreement with the Pope and Bohemia returned back to the Catholic Church. After 14 years, in 1471, George died but before his death he had elected Ladislas II of the Jagiellonian dynasty as a new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS41.D;In 1480 the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold started his campaign against the Empire. Frederick III von Habsburg was defeated and the Empire turned to Ladislas. He entered the war with the forces of the Kingdom united with those of the Empire. After a Pyrrhic victory in Bohemia's favor at Nieder-Olm in 1483, the peace is signed. Even though the Empire lost the war, Ladislas was seen as a savior of the Germans, and in the Imperial Election of 1486 he decisively defeated Maximilian of Austria. At that moment the Jagiellonian Dynasty ruled in Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Bohemia and Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS42.D;In 1516 he was succeeded in all his domains by his son Louis. Eight years passed and Suleiman the Magnificent, Emperor of the House of Osman invaded the Middle Europe in a grand campaign. Louis sent a portion of his army to face the Ottoman threat but he underestimated the enemy and in 1526 the combined Bohemian and Hungarian forces were defeated in the Battle of Mohacs and Hungary fell under direct Ottoman control. The aggression turned to a huge threat to the Christendom and Louis rallied a Holy League of Germany, Bohemia, Austria and Poland-Lithuania. They managed to lift the Siege of Brno and reconquer small piece of Royal Hungary. With both sides exhausted the peace is signed in 1530 and the Ottoman hegemony over Hungary would last almost 300 years. Sigismund, second son of Louis, is given the title of the Margrave of Nitra.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS43.D;Meanwhile in Zurich Zwingli proposed his 95 theses and Louis tried to arrest him at the Diet of Worms but Zwingli managed to escape with the help of the Burgundians. The Protestant started to spread through the Empire as a disease. Louis in response declared himself the Most Catholic King and started to root out the heresy in massive acts of Re-Catholicism and counter-reformation. In 1547 Louis was succeeded as the King of Bohemian Lands and the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by his son Ottokar III who, thanks to his marriage to Elizabeth of Brandenburg - the only heiress of Joachim von Hohenzollern, inherited the Margraviate in 1550. As a true Catholic he began to fought the Protestantism there by supporting Jesuits and the Inquisition. The religious conflicts inside the Empire reached its climax in 1605 when an angry crowd executed the Bohemian-appointed governor of Berlin and declared Brandenburg free. Ottokar IV quickly responded by sending his army to reconquer the Margraviate and restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS44.D;But the events had already begun to move. An alliance of North German Protestant lords declared themselves the Protestant League. They sought support in both Scandinavia and Burgundy - two major Protestant powers. Scandinavia responded with attack on Pomerania. As a reaction the Catholic league of Bohemia, Austria, Bavaria and Poland was formed. In 1615 in the battle of Neubrandenburg are the Bohemian armies almost annihilated and Scandinavians started their advance to the south. The war seemed lost. But thanks to successful negotiations with then King of the Dual Monarchy, Francis I, England-France entered the war in 1616. The Burgundians sued for peace. Nordic forces were decisively defeated in 1619 in the Battle of Melnik. But the northern naval blockade of the Empire was crippling the trade and so in 1621 the peace was signed in Hamburg;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS45.D;Scandinavia annexed Pomerania and abolished the Hansa and Bohemia regained control of Brandenburg and added the Duchy of Saxony to its possessions. The freedom of religion was declared in the Empire. Thanks to the laws accepted in Frankfurt in 1484 the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were excluded from this treaty. Relative stability was reached and the Jagiellonians ruled peacefully for another 150 years. Their dominance in the Empire is threatened only by Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS46.D;In 1790 the German revolution began but the revolutionaries are defeated by the Imperial Army 5 years after. Wenceslas VIII felt that his position was strong enough to centralize the Empire and achieve the Middle European hegemony. The Scandinavians and Burgundians responded with the declaration of war and starting the Great German War. Military success on the part of Wenceslas VIII, dubbed the "Lion of the North," saw many military victories over the Burgundians and Scandinavians. However, after three decades, Wenceslas VIII was forced to realize that he was unable to achieve Central European hegemony and sued for peace, signed in Frankfurt. The Reichstag was reduced and the Imperial Electorates were dissolved but Bohemian Kings would continue to call themselves the Emperors of the German Nation, and retain hegemony over the remaining Eastern German states. Wenceslas would be murdered the following year and would be succeeded by his son, Sigismund V.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS50.T;History of Belgium;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS50.D;Burgundian exploration in the New World began as an enterprise to circumvent both the Anglo-French, whose alliance was terminated with their conquest of Brittany in 1492, as well as the Spanish, who had already begun establishing outposts in Cuba. Through contacts and royal support of Dutch and Flemish mercantile and banking clans, beginning with Jean III, and continuing with Philippe IV, there were several exploration projects, discovering the territories around the Northeast Arcadia and Northeast Ameriga. Arcadia in particular would not see settlement by Burgundian and Flemish colonists until the founding of Philippa in 1529. This would be followed with the founding of Nouvelle Bruges and Port Valois in 1535 and 1547, respectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SS51.D;The first trial of the colonization of New Burgundy came with the Italian Religious Wars (1567-1584), a series of direct and indirect conflicts between the Dual Monarchy (who had already established its colonial holdings and centralized them as the Viceroyalty of New France.) Although most of the fighting was restricted to Northwest Italy and Provence, there were a number of engagements at sea, where both Burgundian and Neo Burgundian ships fought to keep the Anglo-French from capturing the nascent Burgundian colonies, which would only be confirmed in the Treaty of Saint-Denis in 1584. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS52.D;The Treaty of Hamburg that ended the Imperial Wars of Religion (1605-1621), saw Scandinavia ultimately dismantle the Hanseatic League, which was already in decline due to the Scandinavian policy of “Dominium Maris Baltici.” The result of this saw a number of German merchant clans immigrating to Burgundy, and some even to the colonies of New Burgundy and Vinland. These Germano-Septimans would utilize this opportunity, transforming the Burgundian West India Compny into the Neuwelt Hansa (Hanse du Nouveau-Monde in French) in 1669. This move would become the precursor to the federalized nature that would become the Seven Republics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS53.D;During the Great German War (1795-1820), the Burgundians saw fit to raise taxes and tariffs in their colonies (a matter that was also done by ally Scandinavia and Spain.) Discontent over taxation without being formally represented in the Burgundian Estates-General led initially to a revolt for greater rights, which ultimately became a conflict over the right to become its own nation. The Neo-Burgundian War of Independence (1802-1805) was decisive, primarily because of Burgundy being trapped in conflict with Bohemia, as colonials quickly swept away Loyalist garrisons. The Treaty of Ghent confirmed this fait accompli, and thus New Burgundy gained independence as the Seven Republics of New Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS54.D;The new nation differed from most other nations. Taking the model of the New Hanseatic League, the state of New Burgundy was divided into seven confederal Republics as per the name, each ruled by a Grand Pensionary, who would serve as its governor, and serves a subsidiary role to the Stadtholder (Stathouder in French), who would be responsible for the policies affecting all states as well as New Burgundy’s foreign policies. Debates ensued to decide of the name of the new state. The hero of the Independence War and first Stadhoudter coined the term of Belgian Confederacy, taking the name after the antic area from where a lot of the colonists came.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS55.D;Originally ruled under the National Liberals (Parti National Libéral), power shifted to the more jingoistic Moderate Party (Parti Modéré). It was Stadtholder Damien Collet who gave rise to the popular idea of Arcadianism, the idea that all of Arcadia should be united under one government “Par la Raison ou la Force!” (By Reason or By Force!). These jingoistic attitudes led to Vinalnd (who gained independence in 1808) and Plantagenia (who gained independence in 1771) to declare war on the Confederacy.The War of the Double Alliance (1819-1821) was a long and drawn out conflict, that would see war heroes like Jacques Lahure (nicknamed “the Hannibal of the West”) and Willem Le Cocq fight glorious battles against their Vinlandic and Plantagenian rivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS56.D;Septiman military dominance, confirmed by the industrialization of New Burgundy over its rivals to the North and south, ensured that the Treaty of Erikshavn was in their favor, securing Basse-Leonie and various border provinces along the Plantagenian and Vinlandic borders would be in their hands.  However it also brought about a completely new vice, the concept of Slavery, which, despite being restricted to its southernmost Republics, began the debate over the legality of slavery, especially through its claims into slaveholding Plantagenia. The Seven Republics emerged as the most industrialized power in Arcadia, and with it the ideals of Arcadianism could very well be within their grasp...?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS60.T;History of Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS60.D;The Legacy of the Nordic Crowns stem from the personal union of Margaret, Queen and Regent of Denmark and through her son Olaf (who passed in 1387) and victory over the Swedish Magnates, ruler of Norway and Sweden. Thus she became known as the Mother of Scandinavia, beloved by her people. Such successes however would not be shared by her immediate successors. Eric of Pomerania continuously incited conflicts against Schleswig, Holstein, Mecklenburg, and even against various Pomeranian Principalities in his attempt to unite all these lands. This sentiment was not shared by the Swedes, who often traded with these various duchies. In addition, Danish centralization was something not supported by the Swedish Riksdag, including the imposition of the Sound Dues to increase income at the expense of the Hanseatic League, which led to the Danish-Hanseatic War (1426-1435). However he was also credited with the foundation of Copenhagen as the capital for Denmark, and ultimately of the Kalmar Union itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS61.D;It was not to last however, revolts across Scandinavia broke out, in Sweden by the farmers, and later the nobility against his practices, forcing him to yield to Holstein and the Hansa, in Norway a peasant revolt broke out and successfully took Oslo, finally, in Denmark, the Danish magnates refusal to crown Bogislaw IX, the Duke of Pomerania as Eric’s heir caused the King to retreat to Visborg in Gotland, which would later lead to his abdication by all three kingdoms. He would be succeeded by his nephew, Christopher of Bavaria, who put down many of the rebellions in Denmark. Unfortunately he proved to be an ineffective ruler, unable to challenge Eric of Pomerania’s piracy, as well as gain acceptance in Sweden, so much so, and also out of a desire to regain independence, chose its own King, Charles VIII rather than go with Christian I upon Christopher III’s death in 1448.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS62.D;Christian I and Charles VIII initiated a rivalry over the Norwegian throne, ultimately leading to a war which later historians would call the Scandinavian Civil War (1451-1465). Charles VIII successfully resisted all forces sent to depose him, led by the Oxenstierna and Vasa families, and ruled with power shared by the Riksdag until his death in 1470. But Christians troubles did not subside upon becoming King of Sweden, having to deal with various parts of his realm trying to govern themselves locally. Christian was credited with the founding of the University of Copenhagen in 1478. Another credit was the peace made between the Kalmar Union and Scotland, with the betrothal and later marriage of Margaret of Denmark, the daughter of Christopher of Bavaria to James III of Scotland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS63.D;His successor, John I, was the first monarch to balance the interests of the powers involved, attempting to weaken the power of Swedish magnate Sten Sturre and of the Hansa through the support of Novgorod, something which was arranged to best protect them against the forces of the Muscovites under Ivan III. (The Novgorod-Muscovite War of 1496, 1496-1499). The first permanent Danish, later Scandinavian Navy would be founded under his rule, while a brief war with the Swedes (1497) led to Sturre being forced to surrender to John I, and the subsequent creation of the title, Kings of the North. Unfortunately, in an attempt to conquer Dithmarshen in the Battle of Hemmingstedt (17 February 1500), the Dithmarsians trapped John, his son and crown prince Christian, and the mercenaries in a flooded dyke, drowning all involved, opening Scandinavia to the reality of being torn asunder.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS64.D;It would be later that year that Danish magnates, as well as various Norwegian magnates came to bring a relative of John I, his nephew, King James IV of Scotland to become King of the North, a title he would assume as Jacob I. Jacob was the typical renaissance prince, sponsoring Scandinavia’s first printing press, establishing gun foundries in Copenhagen as well as his old home in Edinburgh, and brought renaissance art and science to the Scandinavian nation. He was also responsible for finally subjugating the Swedish rebels under Gustav Vasa (who attempted to crown himself Gustav I). In true renaissance fashion, James IV being the polygot that he was, carried out a reform of the Danish language, utilizing rules and stipulations from the nascent Norwegian and Swedish languages in order to streamline administration throughout Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS65.D;Military reforms were also carried out as well, establishing a united Kalmar Army, which would be put to use in supporting Novgorod in conflicts with Muscovy, as well as bringing Pskov into the fold when anti-Kalmari Novgoroders gained power in the Merchant republic, bringing about the Livonian War (1558-1585) as Scandinavia fought Novgorod & Poland-Lithuania for control over the remnant Livonian Order (later secularized into the Duchy of Courland-Semigalia.His son, James II, and his successor, James III, would be responsible for the establishment of Protestantism in Scandinavia, James II, upon his coronation charter on 7 August 1523, he was made the protector of the Catholic Church of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and in that role he took an opprotunistic approach in weakening the power of Catholic nobles and clergy. But James III was more overt in his views of Protestantism, having been one of the royals to attend the Diet of Worms and was influenced by the doctrines of Huldrych Zwingli.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS66.D;On 30 October 1536, he formally established the Scandinavian Zwinglian Church as the national church of Scandinavia, following the example of the Burgundian monarchs. A brief war with the Holy Roman Empire (1542-1544) prevented the restoration of Catholicism in Scandinavia in support of James III’s brother, Matthew.John III would later be credited with the sponsoring of the first explorations of Scandinavia into the New World, shortly after Burgundy did the same some years earlier. Through his expeditions he would see about the creation of Colonial Vinland, though it would be his son and successor, Eric VIII who would continue and expand such funding, establishing more cities along the Vinlandic coast and even made expeditions into the Caribbean, successfully snatching away the Anglo-French colony of Galatia in what would eventually become Sudurhafeyjar.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS67.D;His successors would also be responsible for its colonial policies in East Asia, gaining access, along with Burgundy, over the Malaccan spice trade, carving out a niche of outposts and colonies in India, the Tondolese Kingdom (later renamed Christiania after Christian II, who was monarch at the time of the colonial acquisition of the Christianian Islands). In addition, outposts and colonies were established in Africa as well, holding control over Mocambike between Zanzibar and Burgundian South Africa, overall, Scandinavia became the second largest colonial power in the Eastern Hemisphere, behind that of the Burgundians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS68.D;Eric VIII would also be responsible for the restarting of the Scandinavian-Bohemian rivalry over the religious affairs of Germany, as well as the Scandinavian desire for Dominium Maris Baltici (Baltic Sea Dominion), the desire for all of the Baltic Sea to eventually become a Scandinavian lake. Despite Eric’s failure for a dominant role in Northern Germany he was able to acquire Pomerania, and directly threaten Jagiellon Poland-Lithuania, the final key to true dominance in the Baltic. However such plans would be laid to waste over the following decades, as Pomerania and Prussia became a battleground, all the while keeping Russia divided in order to ensure its ascendency.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS69.D;This became crucial in the Great German War where Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus V, directly threatened the interests of Scandinavia and its ally Burgundy by threatening to unite and centralize the Holy Roman Empire. Despite the martial nature of Scandinavia, the Lion of Europe scored key victories, even retaking Pomerania from the Scandinavians, and even directly threatening to bring Denmark into the fold. But the various Protestant Princes, not wanting to be destroyed by the major Catholic power brought their resources to bear, and under the leadership of Burgundy and Scandinavia, was able to force Wenceslaus to the negotiating table.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS70.T;History of Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS70.D;Following the French Wars of Succession, the Kingdom of England emerged as the greatest power in Europe during the early modern era. But that did not mean that the English citizens became members of the ruling class. With the majority of the post-Norman English nobility being Francophone, it was not long before further alienation of the upper class from the ordinary Englishmen and the moving of the court of the Dual Thrones to the mainland with England becoming once again just a province of a Romance realm.While portions of the English population, especially in the more populated cities in the South, embraced the French supremacy willingly, abandoning their Germanic roots in the process, the inhabitants of northern England did not give up so easily. As it usually happens in large heterogeneous realms, those on the outskirts felt neglected and discriminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS71.D;As such, the North developed quite a grudge against the Plantagenet monarchy, fuelled by Scandinavians who became united with the Scottish Crown in the early 16th century. Hoping to sow a seed of discontent in the Anglo-French dominion, Scandinavians spread the idea of a Church free from Rome and, by extension, from Paris. The notion of Protestantism was seen by local political elites as a powerful means to gain a degree of autonomy and was wholeheartedly accepted by the common folk who felt detached from the incomprehensible world of Latin liturgy. And thus, the Reformed Anglican Church was born.The Dual Monarchy was initially tolerant to the various branches of Protestantism spreading throughout her realm. Fearing a possible rebellion in England which would most definitely prove costly and difficult for the Court in Paris while having his eyes firmly set on the affairs on the mainland, Édouard V issued the Edict of Cantorbéry in 1553, legalising the Reformed Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS72.D;This document also granted the English nobility a large degree of freedom in their local matters - together with the Irish autonomy, the beginning of the second half of the 16th century saw a major decline of Plantagenet control over the Isles, even though the English Parliament was officially abolished by Édouard's father in 1537. This changed quickly, though. The Irish independence was systematically destroyed during the three Irish Wars and at the dawn of the 17th century the line of appeasement kings ended with François I who aggressively challenged the breakup of the religious unity and stood firm against Burgundy, the champion of the Protestant faith. The Catholic forces eventually emerged victorious in the Anglo-French Wars of Religion, both externally and internally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS73.D;Securing the outer border, François decided to finish the 'Insular Problem' once and for all and while he deployed forces in the Nine Years' War against the Irish, he also abolished the Edict of Canterbéry and began a massive re-catholisation of the English lands. While the nobles, often fearing the loss of their holdings mostly surrendered to the Catholic king, the lower classes did not share the same sentiment. With the lands of Ameriga being gradually discovered by Anglo-French and Burgundian navigators, the desperate Anglicans saw them as the new Promised Land where they shall be granted freedom and independence. And so, similarly to the French Huguenots, large groups of Englishmen refusing to accept the Catholic faith fled to the harbours in the Lowlands from which they set sail towards the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS74.D;Seeking escape from the French domination, the Father Pilgrims (as they will be later named) arrived after facing the difficulties of the Trans-Atlantic voyage at the coast of Neo Anglia, a land even deeper in the south than the Burgundian colony of Nouvelle Amsterdam. Neo Anglia was unofficially claimed by England-France which even established several settlements there, especially near the Riviere de l’Argent. But the Dual Monarchy's zones of interest were wide and so the Court of Paris had to abandon some of its endeavours every now and then. Seeing that Neo Anglia was subject of the influx of Anglican settlers supported by the Burgundians, the Plantagenet administration quickly decided to abandon this potential powder keg which would most probably simply drain the valuable resources of the realm and relocated its focus elsewhere. And so the Kingdom of England-in-exile slowly started to emerge, first independent settler state in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS75.D;The Anglicans, obviously carrying much hatred against Romance languages in general, swiftly started changing remaining Anglo-French names to more suitable ones. Being a mixture of English patriots and fierce Anglicans, the land was designated accordingly - hence you can now visit Seaxburgh and New Jerusalem, Eoferwic and Æthelwulf, all in one country. So in the 1630s, the English settlements started quickly developing with more and more people arriving from Albion, hearing news about the Eden on Earth. A desire for unity began to grow and in 1657 the representatives of important communes arrived at the place where it all began, at the isthmus of the Silver River, eager to build a united country. Fierciely believing in the concept of royal majesty and overall bound by the 17th century mentality, they decided to establish a Kingdom, maintaining the English Crown in exile in South Ameriga.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS76.D;With almost no important nobles being among them, John Cavendish, being a renegade son of the Duke of Newcastle and one of the ship captains who led the first Father Pilgrims in the 1620s was chosen to be the new realm's leader. Cavendish, being industrious and having already scouted the land before during his services as a Burgundian privateer saw the opportunity of carving a power base for himself in the New World and settled soon in the lands of Avalon (the formerly occupied Neo Anglia) and further sponsored the efforts of Anglicans to bring more fellow countrymen to Ameriga. As such, he became a well-known and respected member of the society during the first half of the 17th century. And so John Cavendish, being well in his sixties, became the first King of the new Kingdom in 1658, stylising himself as Edward I. The nation's capital was founded at the Silver River which proved to be an important source of wealth for the Anglicans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS77.D;In tradition of mixing Anglo-Saxon, Anglican and Briton heritage, the city was named Camelot and the Kingdom changed from England-in-exile to Beornicia honouring old Anglo-Saxon settlers with the name soon corrupted to Beornia by popular use. John Cavendish, now Edward I, thus founded the House of Beornia, essentially claiming the Crown of England. But truth be told, no one really cared. Beornia was distant and sparselypopulated and after the initial Anglican influx, the flow of immigrants almost stopped. Devout to Puritanism, with a weird language and even weirder customs, New England quickly isolated itself from the outside world, only dealing with the Burgundian governors from time to time. But even despite that the Kingdom grew. Expanding as far as the Lake Ginosar and even beyond, the Beornian colonists soon came to contact with the Incas in the late 17th century. The massives of Andes proved to be a solid border and no real conflict with the Empire emerged.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS78.D;The 18th century was quite peaceful throughout the Beornian lands, aside of some petty feudal squabbles and battles with natives. The only event worth mentioning was the short-lived war of succession when Henry, the Duke of Godwinson, rose against his infant cousin Harold and the appointed regent Sir Peter Bryne in 1757, seizing Camelot in 1758 only to be ousted by loyalists during the same year, defeated in 1760 and executed the same year. His estates were then appropriated by Sir Bryne who became the new Duke of Godwinson. Eventually, the 19th century and the modern era creeped in, even in Ameriga. The citizens of European colonies started to doubt the oversea governance and one after another started anti-European actions. In 1805, the Burgundian colony of Lotharingia began her own quest for independence and Beornians were quite keen on helping. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS79.D;Arthur III of Beornia, being one of the more enlightened Kings who had his children educated in Europe, believed in the ideals of freedom and hoped that the Lotharians would become another free New World country. He even attended the ceremony in Charlemagne officially celebrating the birth of the Lotharian Republic. Talks over the end of the firm feudal regime and birth of a Beornian constitution ended abruptly, though, in 1817 when Edward IV became King, returning from Europe enchanted by the notion of Bohemian absolutism. Camelot's alliance with Lotharingia held, despite that, more specifically the alliance with the authoritarian elements, especially the would-be dictator De Aigle. With Beornian help, De Aigle was in spite of several major setbacks able to restore order in the newborn republic which was in the middle of a downward spiral. He was a person to Edward's liking, even marrying his niece in 1827, the King dreaming to spread the true English nobility throughout the new post-colonial states.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS80.T;History of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS80.D;The Crown of Aragon’s genesis came from the personal union of Queen Petronilla, Queen of Aragon and one of the last of the Jimena Dynasty, to the Count of Barcelona, Raymond Berengar IV in 1162. Since then, the Aragonese crown grew under successive monarchs, all while maintaining the composite monarchical structure with the incorporation of Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and finally Sicily, achieved with the death of King Martin of Sicily, son of King Martin I of Aragon in 1409. However such victory was short lived with the former’s death the following year, throwing the Aragonese monarchy into chaos for the next two years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS81.D;Ferran’s son and successor, Alfons V oversaw the reunification, if only temporary, of the full Kingdom of Sicily, in 1442 in the Neapolitan War of Succession (1432-1442), and successfully vassalized the Principality of Albania as it was fighting a war with the Ottoman Empire. Alfons believed himself the inheritor of the destiny of Charles d’Anjou, to re-create the Latin Empire of Constantinople, a Maritime Empire stretching from Aragon to Greece. Alfons’ dream, as it became known by successive Aragonese Kings, would be passed down through each monarch since him. After Alfons’ death, the thrones were split, Aragon going to his younger brother John II, while Naples passed to Alfons’ illegitimate son Ferrante.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS82.D;John II, who also served as de facto King of Navarre, spent his reign trying to incorporate Navarre into the Aragonese domain, a conflict that would dominate Aragonese foreign policy during the reigns of his successors Ferdinand II and John III. The Navarrese who opposed him, led first by his eldest son Charles IV, Prince of Viana, and later his daughter Blanche II, led to a sharp rebuke, even among the Aragonese, who’s support for the Prince of Viana ultimately led to the Catalonian Civil War (1462-1472), which saw various claimants, first Charles IV, then later to Enrique IV of Castile, and later Pedro, Constable of Portugal and Rene, Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence. All times John rose to the occassion, and although he lost influence over Navarre, John was able to secure his monarchy for himself and his chosen heir Ferdinand II.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS83.D;Under Ferdinand II, Aragon continued in its battle for the Navarrese, first by supporting the Agramont-backed candidate John de Foix or the throne (even going as far as marrying John’s youngest sister Leonor de Foix), then later after John’s death, utilizing Leonor’s claim to try and bring Navarre into the crown. However this action provoked the newly established Dual Monarchy, provoking the First Navarrese War (1512-1516). This conflict, which saw the Navarrese Kingdom divided between two halves saw the Anglo-French annexation of the Counties of Foix & Bearn on the Northern half of the Pyrenees, while Navarre became a satellite state of the Aragonese Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS84.D;Another achievement made by Ferdinand II was his actions towards the Barbary Pirates. During his reign, Ferdinand expanded the Naval Shipyards at Valencia and Barcelona and built fleets of ships to counter the Barbary Pirates, but he did more than this, after Barbary raids at Palma in the Balearic Islands and in Sardinia, Ferdinand decided to move against one of the Barbary bases, namely Oran and Algiers, held by the Zayyanid Kingdom of Tlemcen. The Aragonese-Algierian War (1500-1512) was the first major conflict Aragon launched against an African power, and the first major conflict since the end of the Reconquista in 1492 (the Spanish conquest of Melilla in 1497 notwithstanding) The twelve year long conflict saw the entirety of the Algerian Coast gained for Aragon, the single largest takeover of Muslim land since Ferdinand III’s conquest of much of Spain. The final expansion of Aragonese North Africa would not be made complete until the Conquest of Tunis, now Carthage, by John III in 1535.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS85.D;John III, known as the “Constable” was known for instituting major reforms to his new domains. Among his reforms, he Chartered Merchant Companies, aimed towards breaking the power of the many Italian Trading families, and reducing internal competition. Workhouses were built for orphans of fallen soldiers, allowing them greater access to careers towards the state and military. But one of the greatest reforms was the centralization of the varying disparate Cortes, bringing together the Parliamentary bodies of Aragon (Zaragoza), Catalonia (Barcelona), Valencia (Valencia), Sardinia (Cagliari) & Sicily (Palermo) into one united Cortes General. Naples would be added to this domain in 1550 with the death of Ferrante III of Naples, thus restoring the patrimony of Alfons V.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS86.D;John III was no slouch in the affairs of diplomacy and war either, as evidenced in the War of the League of Naples (1519-1526). The conflict, pitting the Valois Coalition of Provence, Genoa, Tuscany & Ferrara against the Aragonese-led League of Naples (Aragon, Naples, Papal States, Milan & Modena) saw back and force conflict up and down the peninsula. Ultimately culminating in a Neapolitan League Victory at Bologna in 1525, thus removing all Valois Influence from Italy. Much of Aragon’s succeeding monarchs spent their time dealing with the Threat of the Ottoman Empire, who backed the surviving Barbary Pirates from their bases in the Hafsid Kingdom (or at times against the Ottoman Navy itself from the Balkans) or dealing with tensions against the Trastamaras of Spain or the Plantagenets of Anglo-France. In addition, the Aragonese, especially after the gaining of Naples, cultivated their influence in Italy and Venice in preparation of their Imperial Ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS87.D;Thus it was all the more surprising when the Tuscans killed the Provencal Viceroy in Florence and declared the Etrurian Republic. The threat of a revolutionary republic in Italy was too great for Aragon, especially when it spread its influence across the peninsula by warfare (1807-1814), even directly taking control of much of Naples and threatening their other Italian possessions before finally being overturned. Disaster continued to plague Aragon, as a weakening economy, further support in its foreign policy goals (supporting the Venetian reconquest of the Peloponnese and Attica, and supporting and even supplying an illegitimate son of John IV to the Macedonian throne) and a King who was unable to sire an heir led to a crisis over succession. Enter Josep Serna.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS88.D;Serna was another illegitimate child of the womanizing King John IV, and like his half-brother, the King of Macedon, was legitimized according to the King’s will when John died in 1799. Josep had a storied career as a military officer who took part in many battles against the Djezairid Sultanate of Algeria and during the Italian Revolutionary War. When Alfons VI died in September 1835, the Aragonese Succession Crisis began. The original heir, Ferran VI was crowned later that month, but died within 44 days of his reign, with the throne left to his daughter, Maria. Maria was known for her luxury taste, frivolous spending and a notorious streak of having many lovers. Josep, with the support of the people across the realm went to Barcelona with his fellow soldiers. The Aragonese Parliament, not wanting to go against the will of the people, summoned Josep to the Parliament where he was crowned as King.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS89.D;Thus the House of Serna was born as a Royal Family, to continue the legacy of Alfons V. For the Aragonese desire to create a Mediterranean Lake, a dream shared by the Romans and the Latin Empire of which they claim descent. With the rapidly declining Ottomans and with Italy in their pocket, their dream of such an empire may very well come soon.?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS90.T;History of the Incan Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS90.D;The Origins of the Empire of Tawantinsuyu (Quecha for the Four Regions), known among Europeans as the Inca Empire, started with the rise of the Kingdom of Cusco. Pachacuti, transformed his Kingdom to an Empire with the conquest of the Chanca, and the incorporation of various Andean Kingdoms into this new Empire. Unlike the other preeminent power of the New World, the Aztec Triple Alliance, the Inca would achieve its expansion through diplomacy and intrigue, scouting out prospective kingdoms in terms of political organization, military strength and wealth, and sending messengers convincing leaders the benefits of joining the Empire. Once these Kingdoms were peacefully integrated, the ruler’s children would be sent to Cusco to be taught in Quecha and in Incan administrative systems. Inter-marriages between the Cuscan elite and these children helped further integrate these Kingdoms into the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS91.D;The only serious military campaigns prior to contact with the Chinese, were against their chief rival, the Kingdom of Chimor (also known as Chimu) and against the Mapuche (1470-1493). The former would be subjugated in 1470, while the latter would prove resilient to Inca invasion.During the late 15th century, the Inca would be greeted by traders hailing from Dong Guo City-State of Yongle. This first contact proved very beneficial for the Incans, as it introduced to them horses, gunpoweder weaponry and more importantly, advisors that helped to reform the Incan administrative system, derived from a combination of Incan and Chinese models. This centralized structure helped the Incans in the trials ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS92.D;The death of Huayna Capac I and his son and heir Ninan Cuyochi in 1527 would leave the Inca in turmoil as his two youngest sons, Huáscar and Atahualpa would come to blows against each other in the Inca Civil War (1529-1532) after the former arrested and killed the latter’s supporters. Huáscar would take the reigns, supported by the aristocracy and the religious authorities. However his control was restricted to the southern parts of the Empire, while Atahualpa was well supported by the Northern Aristocrats for his more liberal views of thinking. However he was also supported by the Yongle traders, and with his large reserve of gold and silver, he was able to buy the services of some 500 Dongese soldiers to serve him. Despite being few in number, their weaponry, professionalism and thick armor proved to be one of the deciding factors.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS93.D;The other factor was disease, spread by the recent Spanish colonization and exploration of Mesoamerica, these diseases were ravaging the Incan Empire, this was recognized by Atahualpa, who through the Dongese merchants, procured of the knowledge of variolation, a preventative measure used in China for several centuries. These combined factors, and Atahualpa’s ability to reform and solve these problems, helped to change the tide, defeating and killing Huáscar, and winning the war. The Dongese soldiers that served him would go on to become the Chinu Guard, Chinu being the Quecha word for Chinese).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS94.D;Atahualpa set off for Cusco to be crowned as Sapa Inca, however along the way his party was ambushed by the Spanish expedition led by Francisco Pizarro. Many of the Incan troops were killed, and the survivors - several Yongle soldiers among them - were taken hostage. Atahualpa arranged to pay the Spaniards an exorbitant amount of gold and silver for his release. However, when the payment was made, the Spanish simply took it and kept their prisoners. They intended to depose of Atahualpa and Francisco would be proclaimed the new Sapa Inca. News of the deception spread, enraging Atahualpa’s generals as well as the Chinu Guard. Quizquiz, an Incan general, gathered the remains of the Incan army, and together with new soldiers hired from the Dongese City-States, marched to expel the Spanish and free their emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS95.D;The Spanish, whose original expedition was quite small (just 168 men, 27 horses, and a single cannon), had nonetheless gathered an army from various populations that wanted to see an end to Incan rule. They expected to crush the ‘savages’ easily. Although the Chinese technology was not at the same level as the European military, it was enough to rout the indigenous army loyal to the conquistador, and the elite Spanish troops were overwhelmed by numbers. Pizarro planned to threaten to kill Atahualpa to force Quizquiz to surrender; however, he was betrayed and killed by his associate, Diego de Almagro. Almagro organized the Spanish surrender. The captive Emperor and his guard were released, in exchange for allowing the remaining Spaniards to leave. After their defeat in Tawantinsuyu, Spain sent more troops to reinforce their holdings in the New World. They made reparations to the newly crowned Sapa Inca and negotiated a treaty that would allow Spanish settlers into the northern areas of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS96.D;Historians argue over why Atahualpa accepted the treaty. Some believe that due to mistranslation, or even deliberate deception on the part of the Spanish, that the emperor thought the Spanish were actually submitting to him and asking to join his empire. Others say that Atahualpa knew he could not defeat the true Spanish army, and that he made concessions to prevent the conquest of his empire. The latter would prove true when the Spanish launched a second invasion in 1572 (lasting to 1576), shortly after the accession of Paullu as Sapa Inca, which saw the Incan court moved from Cusco to Chuquisaca, which would serve as the Court of the Inca to the modern day. It would not be until the end of the century that the Inca would find another protector, the Dual Monarchy of England and France. Although the Plantagenets failed in converting the Quecha people to Catholicism, they were able to gain a tributary state, exchanging gold and silver from the mines of Potosi for the continued foreign protection from Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS97.D;The beginning of the Westernization of the Incan Empire began mid-way into the reign of Túpac Amaru II, utilizing traders and support from not only their traditional friends, the Dongese City States (later the Qingqiu Federation) but also from their protectors the Dual Monarchy of England and France. The progress would be slow, as attempts at reform met with sharp reaction by the conservative elite. The utilization of foreign-born officers, weapons and schooling had been some of the steps implemented by during the years of Túpac Amaru prior to his death. These reforms would be slowed down during the reign of his successors Huáscar III and Huayna Capac IV, yet continued in an attempt to keep their independence possible. The Incan Administration began to be reformed under the European (specifically Anglo-French model), while Financal reform saw the tradition Incan currency being replaced with paper currency, the Liwru (a Quechua term for Livre).;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS98.D;During the Spanish-American Wars of Independence, Spain, desperate to put an end to the rebellious Columbian Alliance, asked for an alliance with the Inca in 1828, offering them the Captaincy-Generals of Aqequipa & Quito in exchange for military support. Seeing this as an opportunity to test the combat capability of the new westernized Incan Army, Huayna Capac IV accepted. The Incan Intervention (1828-1832) saw the Incans achieve military success during the early parts of the conflict, reconquering their former capital, Cusco and bringing the Catholicized Quecha to the fold throughout the Central Andes, proceeding to advance towards the titular capital of the Captaincy-General of Quito. This would culminate in the Battle of Lima in July 1830. The Battle was was one that could have gone either way, as it saw the Colombian leader Simón Bolivar killed in the battle. However, it was the Columbians who won the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS99.D;and after two years of little successes and great drawbacks, Huayna Capac IV sued for peace, paying reparations, and relinquishing their hold on Arequipa & Quito. The defeat inflicted upon the Inca convinced the Sapa Inca and many in the leadership that further reforms would be needed, but with Huayna Capac growing old and soon to be dying, the task would soon fall to his son, the Prince-Apparent, Usco. Usco, who wishes to become as great as the great founder of Tawantinsuyu, Pachacuti, wishes to take on the mantle of dragging the Empire into the 19th century, but can he succeed, with hostile Europeans surrounding this great nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS100.T;History of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS100.D;The French Wars of Succession was nothing short of a disaster for the Valois dynasty. The combination of unlucky factors, such as the death of Jeanne d’Arc in 1431, the Burgundians remaining with the Plantagenets with the Treaty of Arras in 1435 and the disastrous defeat at Vichy in 1471 helped contribute to the total annihilation of the Armagnac party. Reduced to its holdings in Languedoc, Auvergne (ruled by the powerful House of La Tour d’Auvergne since 1437) and Provence (inherited from Charles III upon the latter's death in 1481), Charles VIII was forced to sign the Treaty of Rome in 1498, confirming his current domains and the title of “King in France” and Duke of Provence (as Charles IV) in exchange for recognizing the Plantagenets as Kings of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS101.D;The next significant development in the history the Valois was their Italian policy, which began in 1494 with the marriage of Charles IV to Contessina Beatrice de Medici, a daughter of the last Gonfaloniere and first Duke of Florence, Lorenzo I de Medici. Over the course of the reign of Charles IV and his successor François I, they would conduct an effective marriage policy featuring members of the extended Valois family to notable Italian families. Their connections helping to spread the Renaissance culture and style to Provence, as well as helping to contribute Italian words,mixed with the French and local Occitan to what would become the Provençal Language.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS102.D;Unfortunately, this marriage policy would only garner an enemy in the form of the pro-Papal Guleph faction, the pro-Imperial Ghibelline faction, and the Aragonese, who had their own designs of controlling Italy. This would ultimately culminate in the War of the League of Naples (1519-1526) fought between the Valois Coalition (Provence, Genoa, Tuscany & Ferrara) and the titular League of Naples (Aragon, the Papal States, Milan, Modena and Naples). The war culminated in the League’s decisive victory in the Battle of Bologna in 1525, which saw the capture of François I, and the signing of the Treaty of Barcelona, which saw Provence’s Italian holdings (predominantly that of Reggio and Ferrara, with which was held in Personal Union) lost to the various members of the League and the expulsion of Provençal notables from the Peninsula in exchange for his release.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS103.D;Provence’s luck further deteriorated when François, supporting in hiding Huldrych Zwingli in Aix-en-Provence led to the First Provençal War (1522-1525) which saw the Anglo-French annexation of Auvergne (after the mysterious death of the last Duchess of Auvergne, Anne de La Tour d’Auvergne). Open support for Protestantism, as well as François’ continued interference in Italy had led to his excommunication by Pope Adrian VI and a call for Crusade against them. It would be the Avignon Massacre, the slaughter of all clergymen during François’ conquest of that Papal holding that brought both Bohemia and the Dual Monarchy to invade in the Languedoc War of 1532, the second wanting to ensure his title of King of France went undisputed. Burgundian & Aragonese support against the two helped to bring together the Treaty of Nice. François was removed from the Provençal throne, and would be replaced by his nephew, Philip II/VIII. At the same time, the Dual Monarchy would annex the Languedoc region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS104.D;Protestantism would rear it’s head again during the War of the Provençal Succession (1568-1576) which pitted the Catholic and pro-Anglo-French Duke Charles V/IX against his cousin, the pro-Burgundian and Protestant Louis, Count of Venaissin (styled Louis V/XI). It was around during the war that Aix-en-Provence, the traditional seat of the Dukes of Provence were captured by Protestant forces in 1572, on the Feast Day of Saint Bartholomew. As a result, Charles was forced to move his court to Toulon which would become the Provençal capital to this day. Ultimately, the Count of Venaissin was captured and exiled to Burgundy, and Charles would be confirmed as Duke of Provence. Though it would not be until the Treaty of Saint Denis in 1584 that officially ended formal support for Provençal Protestants.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS105.D;Philip III/IX, his successor would prove the ultimate irony however in proclaiming the Edict of Avignon in 1616, which solved the issue of religion by making Catholicism and Protestantism legal throughout the Duchy, the first such nation in Europe that provided freedom of religion for Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS106.D;The events of the second half of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century would see Provence falling into the influence of Aragon. On the other hand, the newly found religious tolerance combined with the Aragonese desire to eliminate all remaining Imperial and Anglo-French influence on the Apennine Peninsula allowed Provençal rulers to normalise their relations with the Italian rulers and consequently to resurrect their Italian ambitions, though now mostly under the baton of Barcelona. The Valois diplomatic efforts would finally come to fruition in 1708, when Louis V/XI of France would marry his only child, Anne, to Giovanni Battista Gastone de Medici, the heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. When Louis died in 1710, Giovanni ascended to the Tuscan throne as Jean I/III of Valois-Medici. His inheriting of the Grand Duchy in 1723 would mark the true beginning of the Tuscan-Provençal personal union and an age of prosperity for the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS107.D;During the Great German War (1795-1820), Provence would be one of the major combatants in the conflict against the revolutionary Republic of Etruria, who through revolution terminated the personal union in favor of a republic. Although they were successful in helping to contain the Republic to Tuscany, they were unable to restore the personal union. With the dawn of the post-Wenceslausian era, the Valois of Provence are now divided on their intentions. Do they continue the fight against the Plantagenets to reclaim their birthright? Or do they go against their masters and seek to unite the Italian Peninsula as successors to the legacy of Charles d’Anjou and Lorenzo de’ Medici. For Provence, despite a long string of bad luck, perhaps they may still rise again.?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

FAQ1.T;Frequently Asked Questions;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FAQ1.D;Here is a compilation of most frequently asked questions about the mod so you don't have to search far for the solution;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FAQ2.D;The history of the World of Divergences is based on several points of divergences which mostly are located in the 15th century : The duke of Burgundy decides to continue his support for Plantagenets in the Hundred Years' War, leading to the latter unifying France and England. The personal union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden survives and evolves to a unitary state and integrates Scotland with the Stuarts leading the Union. Isabella of Spain married a Portuguese prince, instead of Ferdinand II. The Chenghua Emperor does not stop Ming China's explorations, but decides to pursue them with greater zeal than before. That is the rough edges and as you can see many nations have their own histories. Those who do not can be found on the forums where there is a dedicated DVG history thread.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FAQ3.D;Military Access is not a normal diplomatic option in DVG. IOTL (In Our Time-Line for those who wonder) Military Access was not as easy to get as in Victoria II. So in DVG only an overlord can get get access over its sphere members. It can leads to some problems at start but it is rather good in the rest of the game with less shenanigans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FAQ4.D;Bohemia and the HRE : the HRE still exists at start although severely weakened. A Bohemian player can try and restore the Imperial hegemony by warring Burgundy and Scandinavia and keeping the Germans princes under control, all that before 1848. If they don't manage to do this then they are left with a lesser union in North Germany, the Elbian Confederation. The Dual-Monarchy events : The coutnry is divided into 3 great groups, the Anglois, the French and the English. The goal is to choose whether to accept one of the two non accepted or the two at the same time. There are many events with hidden variables so even if you don't think that it makes anything it still does. Spain and the Iberian Union : The Iberian Union is quite a strange concept in Divergences and thus need to be done by force. You have to take Aragonese territories or wait until they lose their Italian possessions for Catalonia to appear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
FAQ5.D;As you can notice if you look at infamy reduction, there is a modifier called 'Lack of International Code'. It models the fact that there is no Concert of europe at start and no formal international treaty on how states should behave. Important changes in Europe will trigger a congress that will remove the modifier but until that you are free to conquer a bit more things;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS120.T;History of Plantagenia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS120.D;Anglo-French colonization of the New World began shortly after its discovery and the founding of Fort St. Francis in 1490 in what is now the Province of Leonie. The Treaty of Pamplona, signed three years later would confirm that lands North of the Cape Verde Islands would belong to them, a fact that was flagrantly violated by not only the Spanish, but also the Burgundians and Scandinavians. Despite this, fact, the colonization of the Southeastern Arcadian mainland proceeded smoothly, with the founding of other outposts, including Talahasi in modern Alibamon province (a French corruption of the original Seminole name, Talahassee) in 1538, and the founding of Nouvelle Orléans in modern Nouvelle France Province. (named after then Duke of Orléans, Francis de Plantagenêt) in 1545.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS121.D;Unlike the Spaniards, who incorporated the Aztec and other tribal ruling classes into the colonial elite, the Anglo-French elite were predominantly those who immigrated from the mainland. Many of the Native Arcadian populace, such as the Seminole, Creek, Chickasaw and Shawnee tribes. Only the Cherokee remained largely resistant to Assimilation, fiercely maintaining their culture, despite being incorporated into colonial rule in the mid 18th century.(the Cherokee language would not see significant reform until 1821 under Sequoyah.);;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS122.D;The Anglo-French colonist also saw significant challenges from rival colonial powers. Despite the traditional Anglo-Franco-Spanish alliance, there were border incidents between the Crown Colony of Plantagenia (as their Arcadian colony was known) and the Viceroyalty of New Spain (and later Viceroyalty of Lusitania) that put a strain on their relationship. This also showed in the hostile relationships with New Burgundy and Vinland, and the various wars fought in the mainland reverberated in the colonies as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS123.D;The road to Plantagenia’s independence from the Dual Monarchy was in a sense, unintentional. It began with the death of King Édouard VI and the subsequent self-exile of Prince Charles to Nouvelle Orléans, where he would serve as the de facto Viceroy of the colony. During his stay there, he reformed the colonial army, transforming it from a series of separate militias into a professional fighting force. It was these reforms that made Charles secure enough to proclaim himself the rightful King of England and France, triggering the Anglo-French War of Succession (1767-1771);;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS124.D;The Plantagenian Army challenged the Dual Monarchy to battle, and because of their superior knowledge in terrain, the use of militia to serve as skirmishers, the support of Scandinavia to supply arms and ships, and the half-hearted support of the Conservatives in power, saw the systematic conquest of Plantagenia for Charles by 1770. However, despite a successful landing in Brittany, the Army of King Charles was decisively defeated in the Battle of Rennes, subsequent battles saw any possibility of maintaining their hold in Brittany unfeasible, and because of the Dual Monarchy’s inability to regain their former colony, both sides agreed to peace. The Treaty of Brest confirmed Henri IX as King of England and France, and Prince Charles as King of Plantagenia as King Charles I, with both sides relinquishing claims on the others’ throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS125.D;Plantagenia enjoyed a great period of peace since independence, maintaining its culture and its rights (slavery still being legal and widespread throughout all parts of the Kingdom), however the threat of Arcadianism espoused by the Seven Republics of New Burgundy was both a curse, in form of its disastrous defeat by their hand in the War of the Double Alliance, and a blessing, as these ideas gave rise to the concept of Plantagenia, not the Seven Republics, being the one to lead a united Arcadia to a brighter future. And so, Plantagenia, convinced of its new destiny, marches forth in the name of enlightenment and King.?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS130.T;History of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS130.D;Scandinavian tradition of colonization can be traced back as early as the Viking Age. Norwegian settlers for the most part sailed West, discovering Faroe Islands and colonizing them. Then it was the turn of Iceland from where Erik the Red, whose father was exiled from Norway and who himself was banned from Iceland, sailed to Greenland. His son Leif would then become the first European to reach Arcadia, calling the land where he landed “Vinland”, “land of the grapes” for savage grapes were found in this place. The Norse settlement was however abandoned after encroachments with the “Skraelings”, the name given to the indigenous population. For 5 centuries, Vinland was abandoned and forgotten while Greenland soon became isolated from Iceland and thus Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS131.D;However, to avoid losing in the course for the colonies, the Stuart monarchy became suddenly interested in sailing West in the end of the 16th century. After the foundation of what would become Plantagenia and the Seven Republics, Hans III, the King of the North desired his share of the cake. The Icelandic explorer Christian Eriksson was hired and went on exploring the coasts of what is now Vinland. Referring to the old sagas, he identified several regions as the ones of the sagas and popularized the use of Vinland as a name for the region upon his return in Copenhagen. His numerous expeditions would lead him to fund several towns, the most famous being Erikshavn (1570), “Erik's port” named after the heir to the Kalmar Union, which would become over the years the most important city of the Nordic colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS132.D;Vinland was the last European colony to be founded in the New-World and the low Scandinavian population made it also the less populated of the continent. The colony was based on the trade of furs, mainly beavers which were highly wanted in 17th century Europe and many settlers were only interested in this trade, making money and coming back to the homeland where they enjoyed a new position. The Religious Conflicts and the first border conflicts with New Burgundy led the Scandinavians to soon take measures to encourage immigration in the area. The end of the Imperial War of Religion would see an important emigration of Germans from Pomerania to Vinland where they would soon form an important part of the population. The seizure of Galatia (Sudurhafeyjar) in the same war would however divert many potential colonists to the rich waters of the Caribbean.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS133.D;With a low population whose main concern was trade, Vinland experimented a very different relation with the natives than New-Burgundy or Plantagenia. Diplomatic relations were soon established between Scandinavia and the Iroquois, the Inuit and the Cree nations. The subsequent treaties which were signed guaranteed the land of the tribes (after some “rectifications” by the Vinlandic settlers) in exchange of the submission to the Nordic throne and a commercial monopoly for Scandinavia. This would lead to a rise of the trade of furs and also influence of Scandinavia which soon ruled over all the Great Lakes. The Nordic explorers would also often embark on travels inland which would lead to the mapping of most of North Arcadia by 1750 and the emergence of the Rohnst people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS134.D;However the rise of the settler population provoked a clash between the Crown and her colony. Reclaiming more lands and more rights the settlers would often ask for renegotiating the treaties with the “Skraelings”, a move the crown was not keen to do because of the influence she exerted over Arcadia because of the same treaties. The situation would tense over the years, the final blow being the new taxes for financing the German Wars leading to the Vinlandic War of Independence in 1808. The Loyalists were soon crushed and the tribes were forced to negotiate new treaties in favour of the settlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS135.D;However the Iroquois Confederation would ask for the protection of the newly independent Belgium, giving the Septimen an access to the Great Lakes. This would mark the first step of hostilities between Vinland and the Seven Republics. Initially, a Treaty signed in neutral Talahasi in 1809 would see the Iroquois Confederate boundary split, with two-thirds going to Vinland and the remainder staying with the Seven Republics. But tensions continued as the rise of the concept of Arcadianism grew stronger. Finally, the threat of the Seven Republics grew too big to simply deal with by diplomacy. Securing an alliance with the Kingdom of Plantagenia, they declared war on the Seven Republics, triggering the War of the Double Alliance (1819-1821). The War was seen as nothing short of a disaster. The lack of population from Vinland proved to be the crucial factor in its defeat and loss of territory stipulated by the Treaty of Erikshavn.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS136.D;Now Vinland stands at a crossroad. It is the biggest nation in Arcadia but also the less populated and both Plantagonian and Septimen are interested to get their share of the Great Lakes. The debate on the Natives situation has grown stronger over the years, stimulated by the opening of the colonization of the inner and northern parts of Arcadia and it may be time for Vinland to eventually choose the fate of the Skraelings. Adding to this situation, the emigration of Iroquois from Septimen territory preferring Vinlandic rule than Septiman exploitation. Moreover Arcadianism has spread to the ideological spheres of Vinland and some are already advocating the idea of Vinland spreading from one ocean to the other and becoming the sole great power of Arcadia.?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS140.T;History of Amazonie;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS140.D;Amazonie was first explored by Spanish explorers during the expeditions of Amerigo Vespucci and was amongst the lands reserved for the Spanish with the treaty of Pamplona. However the violations of the treaty by the Spanish, made the Anglo-French feel not bind by it. The first colony founded was St-George in what was called France Equinoxiale (because near the Equator, days and nights barely last around the same time). The settlements were scarce and the area was clearly void of any occupation outside of the coastal ports of St-George and Bethléem. By 1574, the Spanish and French agreed on a new border on the Amazon River with all East and South territories left to Anglo-French colonisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS141.D;A new movement of colonisation began in the 1610. Attracted by the riches of the “Tribute” Fleet from Peru, many settlers installed on the northeastern tip of Ameriga in what was called “France Antarctique” (Antarctic France meaning the opposite of the Arctic Climate). The immigration there, strengthened by the Atlantic Trade would be unregulated for years, Port Liberté being founded by a Breton pirate around 1640 and only integrated in the viceroyalty of France Antarctique after the construction of a royal fort in the bay. The area would prove to be a pirates’ nest for the whole century, culminating in what some people called the “Golden Age of Piracy” debuting during the Imperial War and continuing with various successes for the rest of the century and ending with the elimination of the last “true pirate”, Bartholomew Roberts in a fight with his old friend Olivier Levasseur.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS142.D;The Antarctiqual colonisation was sponsored by “La Compagnie de l’Antarctique” founded in St-Malo by Breton and Guyennese merchants. Decided to put to use the vast territories void of human presence, they bought many lands in the colony, creating grand domains using slaves workforce and settling there many settlers. Contrary to the Jewel of the Crown which was Plantagenia, Amazonia would see a predominantly French and Breton colonisation and almost no English settlers, the Puritans attracting the people who fled the Dual-Monarchy. Slavery was the main motor of the expansion of the colony becoming the first sugar producer in the whole world after 1700. Conflicts would often erupt on the southern border with Lotharian settlers although the whole Atlantian area became a city of exchange between the Burgundian and Anglo-French colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS143.D;Penetration of the interior was hard because of the climate and it is only by 1790 that most of Amazonie was fully claimed and colonized. The settlers of the East took control of Gouas and Monts-Diamants while Equinoxian settlers would settle Vaura. The War of Succession caused no real change for the colony with only Equinoxia taking a side during the war and sending men to Charles. This act was punished after the war by the reunion of the two vice-royalties into Amazonie, administered in Port-Liberté. The little freedom Equinoxia had was lost and Equinoxian became bitter with the rule of the monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS144.D;The ideas of the German Wars erupted in Amazonia but caused no real riot except in St-Georges where Equinoxian were ready to take up arms against the oppressor. The governor of the colony dialogated with revolters but was ultimately forced to leave in 1825. The success of the Lotharian Independence and the ongoing Spanish-Colombian Wars had only strengthened the revolutionary party. An assembly was called in Port-Liberté to choose the new Constitution of the country. In the end, the Amazonian Federation was declared with the constituent republics of Equinoxie and Antarctique being equals in the terms of power and jurisdiction. However the size and the population of the Eastern Part soon allowed the politics to not mind the Equinoxian inhabitants. Thus slavery was only abolished in the Western Parts while the Eastern planters retained their workforce.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
SS145.D;Profiting from the Lotharingian Civil War, the Amazonian government moved its army to Atlantia and integrated it in the Federation although the claim is still unrecognized by the Lotharingian government and by the local population. Amazonia stands now at a crucial point in its history : Equinoxian are looking west, up the Amazon to settle new lands but who knows what effects it could have with Gran Colombia ? The Antarctic people are now looking south and a similar idea to Arcadianism has spread over some politics, the “Amerigan Ideal”. The balance in the country is already shaking and with potential enemies in the North and a revanchist dictatorship in the South, who knows what awaits the only democracy of the Amerigan continent ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM1.T;Administration of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM1.D;We have reconquered Gran Colombia but now we have to administrate it. We could keep the rebellious colonies under our direct control but it has proved to be inefficient and one of the causes of the rebellion. We could then allow some home-rule with a direct administrator from Spain to rule over the colonies. The question is then how to divide the area : along the old vice-royalties or on a smaller basis ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLMcusco.T;The question of Cuzco;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLMcusco.D;The old imperial city of the Incan Empire is in our hands since the end of the rebellion. Cuzco has been under our control since 1575 but the area is still predominantly inhabited by Quechua people and few have adopted our customs. Some in our government have suggested to give the territories depending of the Arequipa Capitancy to the Incan Empire to thank them for their intervention during the war. Although they were forced to surrender, the Incans decided the issue of the war by killing the Rebel leader Bolivar. Ceding Cuzco would surely assure us a period of peace in Colombia and ease the tensions that have accumulated over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLM_lib1.T;The end of the rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CLM_lib1.D;The rebels have spread liberal ideas throughout Colombia and many people in our colonies are inclined toward these. Many of the soldiers fighting in the war have heard of them and it seems the liberal hydra will be hard to stop. We can choose to keep absolutism and force the colonies to bow before our representatives. However reconciling with them by allowing them to elect their government under our supervision will be appreciated over the Atlantic but will create dissent here in Spain. Or more simply we could grant a Constitution to both the Colombians and the Spanish peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM16.D;After a long and bloody war, Mexican representatives have agreed on peace with the Spanish crown. Gran Colombia is recognized as an independent nation but all the territories dependent of the old vice-royalty of Granada along with Andagoya will be ceded to Spain. Already, crowds are gathering in Nova Lisboa and San Salvador to blame the Mexican government and the so-proclaimed president Miranda for the defeat. What will happen to the Federation ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM17.T;Administration of Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM17.D;The treaty of Cartagena has left us with many possibilities in Ameriga. We could maintain the old order but at the cost of increased rebellions or allow home-rule.

CLM18.T;Legitimity questionned;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM18.D;With the signature of the peace of Cartagena, the hold of Mexico over the Federation has loosened. Both Lusitanian and Mesoamericans are asking for a congress to be held in Mexico to decide of the future of the federation. However many generals fear the outcome of this session and partisans of the war hero Santa Anna want him to take command. Such a move would however only increase the various independentists movements...;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CLM24.T;The Veracruz Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM24.D;Maintaining Order in Gran Colombia has been hard since the accession of Santa Anna to Presidency. Liberals are criticizing "the extraordinary measures" took by Santa Anna and some already think that Spanish domination would be softer than the one imposed by the Mexican miltary. To help fight the secessionist movements in Lusitania and Mesoamerica, Santa Anna has met in Veracruz with Inacio Madeira and José Morazan. The first is a Lusitanian war hero who has led the recapture of Nova Lisboa in the last moments of the war and thus acquired a prestigious figure in Lusitania. The second is the symbol of assimilation of the Native populations, his family indeed originates from Mayan caciques who then became great figures in San Salvador. A leader of the independence war, he is revered by both Mayan and Mesoamerigan populations. Along with these two prominent figures, Santa Anna has designed a plan which divides the country into three spheres of influence until the Federation is ready to fight once more the Spanish. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM25.T;The Monclova Fort;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CLM25.D;Tension have erupted in Tejas since the Veracruz Plan. Madeira has always refused to accept Mexican claims on the territories that belonged to the vice-royalty of Lusitania.

HRE50.T;Bohemian nationalism ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE50.D;"Lion over Eagle!" "We are no Germans!" "Down with the traitor!" These and many more shouts can be heard almost everyday in Prague, Pilsen, Brünn,...The Bohemian people feel betrayed by the recent development in the realm and they fear that their privileged position they have been enjoying as citizens of the Imperial heartland for centuries is waning. Is it a sign of things to come ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE51.T;Bohemian riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE51.D;It started as a meaningless brawl. One drunk Bohemian anti-Imperialist was loudly swearing and a nearby walking police officer tried to calm him down, only to be punched to the face. When the officer tried to defend himself, the drunk pulled a knife, the policeman panicked and shot him in the chest. Other Bohemians seeing that promptly killed the officer, stormed a close weapons depot and started building a barricade in one of the city's streets. Looks like trouble is brewing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE54.T;The Bohemian Revolution !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE54.D;"To arms! To arms! For our freedom and our pride! Down with the German tyranny!" After a series of incidents following the unification of the Holy Roman Empire and the subsequent centralisation acts, the situation in Bohemia escalated in a full-blown crisis. Bohemian aristocrats formed a national assembly and declared the Bohemian Crown Lands independent from the rest of the Empire. Disgruntled Bohemians, joined by many veteran soldiers of Holy Roman armies are already flocking to their ranks, gearing for war. Is peace in central Europe really a dream impossible to come true?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE55.T;Intervention in Mitteleuropa ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE55.D;With the Bohemians rebelling, we have a chance to cripple the Kaiserreich. For glory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE56.T;Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE56.D;At last we have succeeded. The war cost us many lives but we have secured our homeland from the traitor Kaiser ! Let it be known that Bohemia will never bow again before the Germans !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE57.T;Bohemian Mobilisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE57.D;Now it is obvious that the war between the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia will be fought on a scale never seen before. The Bohemian citizens are en masse joining the Free Corps and donating their belongings to the war effort. The story of a girl who, having no other property or money, donated a lock of her hair is just one of the many. The Bohemian lion is now standing tall, ready to take on his enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE58.T;Prague is lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE58.D;Ein Reich, ein Deutschland. That's easier to say than to fulfil. The Bohemians decided not to be just regular members of the Holy Roman Empire and somehow managed to defeat our newborn country, striking a deep wound into its flesh. With the blue-red-white tricolour flying over the Prague Castle, they have lost the chance to be full citizens of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE59.T;The Revolution was crushed !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE59.D;Ein Reich, ein Deutschland. Only fools would want to stand against the wind of destiny. The foolish Bohemians have tried to do just that and paid the price of blood for it. But our Empire has bled, too, and so it is important that the peace shall now rule in Mitteleuropa for eternity. And thanks only to our glorious nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
HRE60.T;The new Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

announce_interest_SAF_title;The Boer States;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
announce_interest_SAF_desc;The Cape Duchy was established after the end of the German Wars and is the sole area we could take back from the old Boer colonies. The duke of the Cape has sent us many messages, urging us to enhance our position in the area to protect the colony we have allowed him to rule. Moreover, it seems that Africa is becoming interesting for Great Powers and it will be good for us to have a stronger position when the real colonization begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SAF1.T;The Leuwin state;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SAF1.D;The Leuwin state was constituted by the infamous brother of the Duke and has been provoking us for too much time. He'll understand what is Burgundian rule or we will make him understand !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAF8.T;The Burgundian threat;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SAF8.D;The Boers from Nieuw Antwerpen have asked us to unify to fight the Burgundians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SAF9.T;Boer unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SAF9.D;The remaining Boer republics have unified and created the state of Batavia. The idea of this state grouping all the Boers is a threat to our domination in the area and the Duke has already asked us to intervene against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

SAF11.T;The republic of Nuweflander;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
SAF11.D;With our control of the coast, only remains the republic of Nuweflander. The last expedition mounted against them was a disaster and cost the lives of 15000 soldiers in the process. We have to make them pay this act !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TURREB.T;Defeat of the Janissaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
TURREB.D;The Janissaries that had revolted against you have been defeated ! Unable to capitalize on their successful Anatolian uprising their movement has been routed and cities are each day welcoming us as their new saviours. The main leaders have been captured and beheaded, their heads thrown into the Bosporus. We have captured their arsenals and supplies to help for the war effort It is likely we won’t see another rebellion soon : most of the populations are weary and only want peace after decades of war.

EGY51.T;Misri Al-Nahda;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
EGY51.D;Glory to the house of Zahiri ! Not only have they managed to push the Turks out of Egypt but our troops have conquered one of the Holy Cities, Al-Quds. With Palestine in our hands, people in the Levant are already approaching us to liberate them from the Sultan’s yoke. This crushing victory has proven the legitimacy of the Zahiri dynasty and all opponents are now mute before the success of Sultan Muhammad. Determined to end Arab decay he has used his great popularity to introduce great reforms in the country and most European courts think of him as a potential interlocutor in the Middle-East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
egypt_levant_title;Egyptian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CRO1.T;Illyrian Brothers ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x 
CRO1.D;The ongoing Ottoman Civil war present us with an interesting choice right now. We have asserted our independence from the Empire recently and we have become a beacon of hope for the Slav populations living under the Muslim yoke. A proposition was made recently to enter a war against the Empire to free Serbia before Hungary or another vulture takes the territory for itself. Or we could just wait for the Empire to be in an even worse situation and take the territory for ourselves ….;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CRO7.T;Intervention in Montenegro ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO7.D;Before the Civil War, Montenegro was divided in various principalites. The Metropolitan finally achieved unification around him and went on expelling the powerful Simic family which ruled Kotor. The heir to the war hero Peter Simic, Joseph Simic is an idealistic panslavist and he has many times confessed that his father wanted Montenegro to join the Illyian kingdom. We could let him act and enter Montenegro with followers to see if we could not force the Metropolitan to bow before us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO8.T;The Simic rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO8.D;The Illyrian have allowed the claimant to the dukedom of Montenegro, Jospeh Simic to sneak into Kotor where he actually tries to convince people to join our heretic neighbour. Should we take action against him, it is likely the Croat will advance into our country so we must try to find someone to back our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO9.T;Simic suceeds !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO9.D;Our agent, the duke of Kotor has taken power in Montenegro and has asked to join our kingdom !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO10.T;Montenegrin embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO10.D;The Illyrians threaten the rule of the Metropolitan who has asked us to protect him. How should we react ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO11.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ supports Montenegro !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO11.D;The Metropolitan has been swift to act against Simic. He expelled him and has found an ally to protect him in case we decide to invade his country ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO12.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ threw away the Montenegro embassy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO12.D;The Metropolitan tried to find someone to protect him after the expulsion of Simic but $FROMCOUNTRY$ refused to protect him. We can now easily override their defences and annex Montenegro into our glorious kingdom !;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO13.T;The status of Belgrade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

CRO14.T;Illyrian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
CRO14.D;The Illyian King has issued a declaration in which he demands us to relinquish the Serbian lands we captured during the Civil War. The Serbs have been restless around their old capital and holding unto them will harm relations with our allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Ultimately most of the settlers came from Mexico and now that Lusitania is independent they could prove to be a fifth column in the case of a war against their Southern neighbour. Thus it has been proposed to relocate them in Tejas and Santa Catarina amongst the local Castillian-speaking community where they could be better controlled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Kita1.D;With the Japanese Empire controlling the frozen lands of Kita Kaigan many of our politicians are afraid of Kyoto using their bases there to threaten our Republic.

This terrorist organisation has been created by the Kaiganese who are the descendants of Korean and Japanese liberals who fled Asia for what they considered a forgotten haven. But the Empire has strengthened its rule over its colony and they have decided to act to obtain an independent Kaiganese Republic.

TUS_setupT;The political situation in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TUS_setupD;Etruria is the last remaining republic born during the German Revolution. The revolutionaries expelled the Valois-Medici and created sister republics all throughout the peninsula but were forced to negotiate peace and leave the Reaction take over the new Republics. Italy is now as divided as before the Revolution and Etruria is no longer perceived as the hegemon of Italy. Internally, the Priors, whose main base in Florence are the Uffizi and the Piaza Dei Priori, hence their name, rule now again the republic but they are challenged on their left by the Carmagnolesi, the hardcore revolutionaries. On their right the Peasants do not want the Revolution to go further and the Compromisers want Peace in Italy. Some Provenzale supporters still dream of the return of the Valois-Medici but forces of Reaction are weak. If Etruria can surpass petty political rivalries then maybe they'll be able to unify Italy and threaten the old European Order!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ETR9.D;The famous Doria family is one of the most powerful Genoan aristocratic families. Members of the family have held offices throughout the history of the Republic : admirals, condotierri, politicians … Andrea Doria held the highest position of the Republic when the Etrurian Revolution happened. Inspired by Enlightenment ideas he allied with Etruria and promulgated several laws in favour of the lower classes of the Republic. The oligarchs fled to Savoy after the Dorian supporters proclaimed the Republic of Liguria. However after we signed peace with Aragon the oligarchs were soon put back by a joint Anglois-Savoyard coalition and Andrea Doria and its government fled to Firenze where he has lived since.. But now we have activated our cells in Italy Andrea has embarked on a boat toward Genoa. We hope he can liberate his homeland from oligarchs and Anglois influences!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ETR10.D;Doria, the Consul of the short lived Republic of Liguria has decided to come back to Genoa! The current government is quite threatened by this situation.

The crowds are already cheering for his return and a small garrison has defected to him. “The Thousands” as they are called are ready to enter Genoa proper : the government can rally the loyalists and crush the coup or let the Dorians take back power and re-establish the republic of Liguria. What will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR11.T;The failure of the Thousands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR11.D;Andrea Doria and his followers have been executed by the oligarchs of Genoa! The reactionary forces rallied and shot the crowd who came to cheer for the reestablishment of democracy in Genoa.

Alas the Aragonese regrouped and the Republic was dissolved and its officials fled to Etruria. Francisco Pepe has embarked yesterday to Naples without alerting our government to propagate the Revolution.

Eventually they were annexed by Aragon who put a puppet on the throne. But now they shall be forever be our brethern!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR23.T;Unita!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
ETR23.D;Italy has been united! Now the little states that constituted North Italy are but a memory and we shall never be divided again !;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR24.T;The Greek Problem;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ETR24.D;Greece was 'protected' by the Serenessima after the Ottoman Civil War. TWe are now in possession of these lands and some have suggested to give all Greece autonomy. It is true that the whole country is hard to manage but others have proposed to keep Crete and Cyprus which possess a large Venetian community.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
ITA1.T;La Questione Meridionale;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA1.D;The Mezzogiorno has been freed from Aragon but the differences with the rest of Italy are still important. Industry is flourishing in Lombardia and the rest of Northern Italy while the Southern provinces are still primarily rural. The Northern Italian people control most of the offices of government and the South is feeling neglected. Resentment is high in the Catalan speaking communities that are dispersed throughout the Two-Sicilies and who regret the rule from Barcelona. Our government officials have observed lately an increase of departures to the New World and it seems that if we do nothing then the phenomena will become more important...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA2.T;The Arborean Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA2.D;Sardinia and Corsica are the most problematic provinces of Italy. Despite their annexation to the Italian state governing is hard because of the isolation of the islands and of the number of Catalan people throughout the island. Unified Italian is barely spoken even in the ports and vendettas between rival families are still common with the authorities unable to discourage them. Recently entire families have been seen leaving the ports to the New-World and officials fear that it could be the beginning of an important emigration movement. A solution has been drafted to include the locals better into Italy but it comes with a cost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA3.T;Venetian Complaints;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA3.D;The Venetian people was for the greater part neutral in the process of independence, not associating with the unification process. Eventually they joined their brethren but many of the locals feel betrayed by the Roman government that has stripped them from their privileges. We can try to improve the situation or let it go which will surely trnaslate into numerous departures towards the New-World and increased dissent in the remaining Venetians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA4.T;The New Republics;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA4.D;The Dual-Monarchy has imploded and 4 new republics have been carved out of the corpse. We represent the success of the revolutionary ideal and both the French and Occitan republics look upon us to lead the way in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA5.T;Italian Embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ITA5.D;The Italian Republic has decided to agree on an alliance between our two republics. Long live the Republic!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ainu_ann.T;Japanese imperialism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ainu_ann.D;The Ainu protectorate has been annexed by the Japanese who have decided to formally take control of the coast north of the Home Islands. They are surely gaining power in the area and it will surely announce a renewed interest in Siberian lands from Kyoto.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

help_germany_title;The heart of the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
help_germany_desc;Germany was the heart of the Revolution but alas the old Republican flame is nowhere to be seen across the Alpes. Our Republic has the duty of helping our fellow revolutionaries to have a solid ally in the North! We need to pay caution though since it will surely not be to the liking of Burgundy and Bohemia...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER1.T;The Congress of Roma;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER1.D;Roma, the Eternal City and our capital is hosting a German Congress with representatives coming from across the Alpes en masse. Mainly hardcore republicans, this Congress allows the different factions to regroup around one objective : German unity. The President of Italy will soon be making a speech in front of these radicals and many fear that he will actively join them and wreak havoc in Germany once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER2.T;A Secret Pact with Paris ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER2.D;We have announced our support of the German republicans but now we have to face the fact that we will be alone in this fight against two of the greatest European Powers. The government fears that Italy and the Danubians might clash with too many forces and so some have suggested to send an envoy to Paris, suggesting them that we could have no problem with them getting Bourgogne if they were to intervene in Germany...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER3.T;An Italian proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER3.D;The Italian ambassador has contacted us about a secret pact between our governments. The Italians fear that Burgundy will intervene in Germany and they'd want us to alleviate the Western Front. It would be the perfect occasion to take back Bourgogne but we would also support republicanism...;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER6.D;Sponsored by Italian arms and equipment the German radicals have managed to take Munich and whole Bavaria in a swift act.

New German Wars will happen but the outcome is yet to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GER21.T;The Berlin uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER21.D;Dissent has been high in the Elbian populations under the heel of the Bohemian Emperor. Ever since the recent conquest of Pomerania the Northern regions of Germany have been a revolutionary nest opposing the domination of the Bohemian elites. Yesterday  a group of students has launched a violent demonstration in Berlin that ended with the local police completely overwhelmed. The surrounding areas have now rebelled against Bohemia, joining the fight with the Danubians!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,, 
GER22.T;Joining the League;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER22.D;Should we join the Elbian uprising ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER23.T;Repression;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER23.D;Our forces in the North may have been neutralized because of those pesky Elbians but we will never allow an independent state in Berlin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER24.T;Unrest in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER24.D;The annexation of the Pomeranian lands have increased the dissent from the German nationalists. The radicals have met yesterday in Berlin and drafted a plan for an Elbian 'League' to arise and push back the forces of the 'false-emperor'. Hopefully we encountered the threat and most of them are now either in exile or prison but it seems their idea is gaining weight in the local population.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER25.T;Unification ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER25.D;The Danubian Federation and the League of Berlin share the same agenda : the unification of Germany. Representatives from both states have argued about unifying the two leading forces of Germany into one. Should we propose it ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER26.T;A Danubian Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER26.D;The Danubians are proposing us to unify our state which would basically be Germany unified. Do we accept the proposal ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER27.T;The Compromise of Berlin;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
GER27.D;The two German states have unified today, bringing much of Germany under their power. German unification will surely be completed soonly.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG1.T;The Khanate;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG1.D;The Khanate of Dzungaria is the last great remnant of the Mongolian Empire. Founded by OIrat Mongol in the XVIIth century it grew in importance in the following century unifying the Mongolian camps and vainquishing the Qing during several campaigns. It is said that it’s thanks to the Oirat that China is not dominated by the Manchu. The actual Khan, Galdan converted to Islam following his conquests of Samarkand and khiva but has shown tolerance towards the Buddhists lamas of his realm. While already aged he has said he wanted to advance into China but already his sons want to divide the Khanate following their desires….;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG2.T;The death of Galdan Khan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG2.D;Galdan Khan, the supreme chief of the Asian steppe died yesterday at the venerable age of 76 years. The size of the Khanate combined with the ambitions of his sons has seen the Empire already divided, each army pledging an oath to a different son. The heir Tushiyetu has seized the crown lands of Dzungaria but he now must choose : will he try to stop his brothers’ ambition or will he completely let the Empire disrupt ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG3.T;Reclaiming the Tarim Basin;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG3.D;The Khan let his brothers disrupt the Khanate years ago but Uyghurs have been a thorn in our side for too long! They often pose problems in Urumqi siding in feuds of their community and trade routes have been let to waste under their rule. The Oirat must step up and take back this territory in memory of our great Khans!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
DZG4.T;The legacy of Genghis;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG4.D;The Khanate of Mongolia is our principal opponent in the area. The Mongols are our direct brothers compared to the Turkic people of the Steppes but their leader is too ambitious to accept our hegemony without fighting. Some call on to our leader to use the new knowledge he gained to strike at our enemies and see them submit once again before their rightful Khan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG5.T;Submitting the Kazaks;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG5.D;The Kazakh Khanate lies in the steppes of the West. With our base secured in the East there has been talk about annexing back the Kazakhs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG6.T;The Tuvan Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG6.D;Tannu Tuva is a desolate frozen place. Sitting on the north of our border, we have little interest in attacking them but it would be nooying that someone else took the lands instead of us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG7.T;Modernization of the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG7.D;The Western World is coming to the Asian Steppe. We feel it everyday with new ideas spreading through the old Silk Road. Fortunately we are isolated naturally with Siberia and the Divided China not allowing the Europeans to approach our cities and peoples. But the Khan has had enough. Japanese, Russians, all are looking into the Future and they will surely threaten the Oirat when they are ready. To this extent the Khan has gathered a little group tasked to find help in this modernization process but where shall they be sent ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG8.T;Coming back from the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG8.D;Our expedition has eventually come back from the West! They have brought with them limitless knowledge on politics, science and war. They have also established contact with most of the khans of Europe, who for most of them did not know the existence of our glorious country! To serve as military advisers they have also hired ‘Cossacks’, great warriors from the Western Steppes they claim. Their leader the Baron Roman Stroganov-Romanov, a disinherited noble has made a great impression to the Khan but he seems to be an ambitious man, full of eccentricities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG9.T;The Cossack Baron;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG9.D;Roman Stroganov-Romanov is a strange man but he has found his home here in the open steppe, riding a horse with a falcon on his wrist and feeling the wind in his hair. His military ability in the recent campaigns is worthy of praise. Despite his foreign background he is well perceived by the quriltai. We could nominate him as our right arm, ‘Minister’ as they say in the ‘civilized’ states, make him the leader of our forces or order him to leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG10.D;Tibet is the religious center of the Buddhists of Central Asia. The dalai-lamas were installed rulers thanks to the Oirat two centuries ago and we have thus acquired a special place in Tibetan affairs. The current Dalai-lama is rebellious and has vigorously condemned our expansion through Asia. Our European minister has proposed we conduct a punitive expedition to make the Dalai-lama understand his place and why not recuperate some territories settled by Nomads ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DZG13.T;The Asiatic Legions;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG13.D;Our minister Stroganov-Romanov has been pushing for some time for a modernization of our armies. He wants to institute 'Asiatic' Legions with professional officers trained with mixed European and Chinese tactics. This project is widely refused by our traditional belligerent elite and the actual officers who might lose their position. But if the reforms were to pass we would then acquire an ascendant on our neighbours !;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG14.T;The Mad Baron;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG14.D;Since he was left on his own in the steppe by the Oirat Stroganov-Romanov has been going mad. Lately he has assembled a whole corp of cavalry, delcaring his intention to build a Great Empire to purge back Europe. Thus he has attacked the Khan in Ugra to take power in Mongolia. If he wins he has declared that the Oirat would be next.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG15.T;Mongolian attack;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG15.D;Stroganov-Romanov has taken control of Mongolia and has decided to 'purge us' for our faults!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG20.T;The Creation of the Urumqi university;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG20.D;Amongst the men who came back from their mission to the outer world years ago, a wealthy Uygur from Urumqi has decided to build a library in our capital and has asked for our patronage. The collection is limited, consisting mostly of Buddhist treaties and Qur’ans but he says that he could try to buy them abroad with our help. Moreover he says we could establish an institute tasked of educating the children of our nation and help the development of our growing bureaucracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG21.T;Cave paintings;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG21.D;Our University still growing has welcomed several European archaeologists following certain discoveries in the Tarim basin. Apparently European looking people appear in cave paintings from the area and it has interested many archaeologists. What should we do about this discovery ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG22.T;The Tocharians;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG22.D;Central Asia has entered on the world stage following the recent findings of archaelogists in the Tarim Basin. Cave findings and other remains have made the world discover a new civilization there, since long dead but who seems to be the Tokharoi described in the Greek texts. Anyway these findings have increased the prestige of the Oirat state which despite his entrance in the Modern World is still very isolated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG23.T;The question of script;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG23.D;The National Library of Urumqi is filling with books since our investment! But our scholars have asked ourselves which script we should use for the translation of foreign books into our language. Central Asia has been using plenty of ways of writing : Muslim elites often use Arabic, merchants used Chinese, monks use Tibetan... A Mongol script was created by Genghis Khan and is still enduring. We could also adapt the Latin alphabet to our needs and become closer to the Western World or promulgate Arabic to please the Muslim populations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG30.T;A Dzungar caravan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG30.D;Yesterday a ship brought several Oirat men with gifts from the Khan in Urumqi. They have asked us to study here in Japan for a while before going back to their homeland.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG31.T;Return from Japan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG31.D;Our chosen men who travelled to Japan have come back filled with new knowledge gained in the Japanese universities. A lot of them have come to consider Japan as a natural ally for our country and with them getting new positions at the court, the Tenno can count on several allies in Urumqi.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG32.T;A Japanese Request;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG32.D;Yesterday a caravan has arrived from Japan with a letter from the Emperor. He asks us to protect a group of Buddhist monks who want to travel to Tibet without crossing the ever-warring China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG33.T;A Japanese lama;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG33.D;Yesterday a caravan arrived from Urumqi with several Japanese monks who have come to study our sacred texts and establish better relations between Japan and Tibet. Their leader Kawaguchi has already gained the support of the current dalai-lama, who considers him one of the most 'wise monks' he ever encountered.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG34.T;Japanese enter Lhasa!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG34.D;A group of Buddhist monks have entered Lhasa, the isolated capital of Tibet. Few men have and their success brings prestige over our nation!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG35.T;Operation Tsunami;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG35.D;The Steppe is a hard place to control. Far from our Home Islands and empty they only have interesting ressources. It is thus more interesting to use 'friendly regimes' to rule over these populations. The Dzungar Khanate would be a fine target as a puppet of our glorious nation and would enhance our position as masters of Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DZG41.T;Return from $FROMCOUNTRY_CAPITAL$$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG41.D;Our delegation has finally made its way back to Urumqi! They have spent many months in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attending to universities and military schools. They seem to have been quite the attraction in Europe from what they say and we are now known to European courts as an effect.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DZG42.T;'Travels to Europe';;;;;;;;;;;;x

holy_crown_HUN_title;The Crown of San Stefen;;;;;;;;;;;;x
holy_crown_HUN_desc;The Holy Crown of Hungary, the very embodiment of our state is in the hands of the Bohemian Kings who still like to pretend they are claimants to the throne. Alas for us no Hungarian King can be considered truly worthy of ruling until he has been crowned with the Holy Crown of Saint Stefen, first King of Hungary. Now we can ask the Emperor to give us back the Crown but it will likely come with demands…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN1.T;An Hungarian Envoy;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN1.D;The Holy Crown of Saint Stefen is the most important relics of Hungary. No Hungarian King could really be considered worthy of ruling until he had been crowned with this very Crown. The Kings of Bohemia have been in control of the Crown since the Ottoman Conquest, transferring the Crown in Prague where it would not be threatened. But the Dukes of Nitra we established to protect our lands proclaimed themselves Kings of Hungary following the expelling of the Turks. Gabriel I of Hungary has come to ask us to relinquish the Crown once and for all and is ready to “give in to any demands”.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN2.T;Bohemian Answer;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN2.D;The Emperor has granted our request without any demands ! The Crown has been escorted to Budapest where Gabor I was formally crowned King of Hungary. It will surely inaugurate a new period of peace between our Kingdoms!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN3.D;The Emperor will only relinquish the Crown if we go to Prague and kneel before him. This move would damage our international status but we need it to secure our Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN4.T;Humiliation of Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN4.D; After negotiations the King of Hungary has come to Prague to regain the Holy Crown of Saint Stefen. The most precious relic of the Kingdom was only given to Gabor I after he knelt before the Bohemian Emperor in an humiliating ceremonial. The move has critically damaged the international standing of the Hungarian Kingdom along with their relations with Bohemia. One can guess that Bohemia made a serious enemy of her neighbour…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN5.T;End of negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN5.D;The King of Hungary has refused our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN6.D;The Bohemian Emperor has asked us to release a semi-independent Duchy of Nitra in exchange of the Crown of San Stefen. Nitra was the march installed by the Jagiellon to protect the Empire from Turkish attacks but it was ruled by Hungarian noblemen following the marriage between Charles Bethven and Maria Jagiellon, duchess of Nitra. The Hungarian revolution saw the duke of Nitra become King of Hungary by popular demands but it felt like an insult for Prague. Giving up full control on the duchy will surely be a thorn for our Kingdom but we would gain the Holy Crown…;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN7.T;The New Duchy of Nitra;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN7.D;At our demand the King of Hungary has offered autonomy to the Slovaks and we have been allowed a right to intervene in their affairs;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN8.D;The Bohemians have refused to give us the Crown and they will refuse all concessions we might offer...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN9.T;Prague Heist!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN9.D;Stupor has struck Prague after an attempt by Hungarian nationalists to gain the Holy Crown! A dozen of Hungarian plotters bribed their way in the Castle of Prague and killed at least 27 guards before being caught. The question made them reveal that they were helped by the Hungarian government after the failure of negotiations to gain the Holy Crown. Such a slanderous behaviour needs to be addressed firmly without waiting for ‘apologies’. We’ll make Hungary pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN10.T;Heist Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;x
HUN10.D;Our government had secretly funded Magyar nationalists to steal the Holy Crown in Prague and bring it to Budapest but the Heist did not go as planned. Now Bohemian Forces are mobilizing and we must now march to Prague and take back the Crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

INC_archa1.D;Machu Pichu, an old seat of power from the Great Incas, which no one visited for hundreds of years is once again under our control! Most of the knowledge about the mountain has been lost during the Spanish conquest and the few inscriptions we have tell us that it was Pachacuti himself who chose the site to be one of his residences. We have also found a great temple dedicated to Inti in the ruins and the priests of the Empire have asked that they be given the site to build a great sanctuary to honour Inti and the past Incas. The site would also be a magnificent retreat for our sovereigns if we renovated the whole place. Also the European advisers of our court have expressed their interest in funding missions to study this example of our old Civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

124213.D;The Pope, being the head of the Church command a wide respect amongst the faithful in Italy -and abroad.

Of course his critics on secularism, liberalism and his secular power were left out of the newspapers...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124214.T;Papal Hostility to the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124214.D;The Pope, the head of the Catholic Church has issued an encyclical against the 'sins' of Etruria and calling for the good Christians to denounce their behaviour and their ideas. Religion is an important societal component and his actions have left the Etrurians weakened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

124215.D;Etruria is far from being respected amongst the European powers and it has thus been hard for them to appear as the obvious leader of the Italians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124216.T;Anglois bribes;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124216.D;Since their conquest of Provence the Dual-Monarchy has been interested in creating an Italian state favorable to their interests. Recently we have heard that some members of the Council would have changed their stance following 'gifts' from Paris, thus hampering our progess toward Italian unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124217.T;Eturian greatness;;;;;;;;;;;;x
124217.D;Etruria is respected as a Great Power in Europe and thus appear as the natural leader of the Risorgimento.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya1.T;Debates in the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya1.D;The Congress that opened to decide the future of Gran Colombia is divided into three great tendencies : Miranda and the united Colombians want the current situation to endure and Spaniards to take over the New-World, Granadans separatists want to leave the Federation thinking Mexico has taken too much power and finally the Federalistas want to return to smaller republics and end Mexican hegemony over Lusitanians and Salvadorians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya2.T;Trouble in the streets;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya2.D;Nobody knows how it exactly happened and who started these events but Salvadorians and Granadans have begun fights in Andagoya City. The Congress must decide who to support and who to blame. Punishing the Granadan leaders will help the Granadan cause while condemning the Salvadorians would help the cause of the Federalistas;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya3.T;Support of the Church;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya3.D;The Catholic Church has issued a decalration supporting the Union of all good Hispanic catholics into a single country, fearing that division would only lead to successes of liberals, atheists and Quechua pagans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya4.D;Even in the Church there exists division... The bishops of Granada have decided to support the Granadan independentists criticizing the power the Mexicans have accumulated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya5.D;The dissensions amongst the Hispanic peoples are perceived even in the Roman Catholic Church! The archbishops stand divided, each supporting the local nationalists and refusing to allow Mexico to gain even more weight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya6.T;The Colombian Army;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya6.D;Now that the war has ended many are questioning the role the Army should have in our state. The Tetrarchy of generals might have been a necessary evil but many Liberals fear that letting them keep some power will only only lead to coup d'Etats and could also lead ambitious men to secure personal power...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya7.T;The status of Indios;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya7.D;The native people have been freed from the previous colonial system of encomienda and castas but they are now asking for more power and representation in the state. Gran Colombia was founded as an Hispanic country and critics would fall down on the government if privileges were given to the 'Indios' and could potentially lead to the death of the Colombian Dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya8.T;Abolition of Slavery;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Andagoya8.D;Slavery is a widespread pratice throughout Gran Colombia with Afro-Latino representing the second ethnic group in the Federation. It is also vital for the haciendas held by great landowners but also heavily criticized by many liberals who have decided to debate the issue in the Congress.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VAL31.D;The new Occitan Republic will be loyal to us!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL32.T;Trial of Philippe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL32.D;When we took Toulon we also captured the Duke of Provence, the heir of the tyrans we fought and pretender to the Grand-Duchy. We tried to make him abdicate all claims on Tuscany, Provence and France but he is stubborn, refusing to deal with us. It leaves us in a problematic situation. Many in Etruria want to see him test the Fallschwermaschine after a 'fair trial' but it would also offense most of European monarchies ...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL33.T;Riot of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL33.D;Yesterday a riot erupted in Avignon after a zealous Etrurian commissar had killed 'an enemy of the Revolution' without trial. Dissent against Italians is growing in our Republic...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL34.D;Yesterday a riot erupted in Avignon after a zealous Etrurian commissar had killed 'an enemy of the Revolution' without trial. Our supervizion of the new republic is increasing the dissent amongst the common man who doesn't understand why we are still here. We could let the new Occitan government handle their destiny and just stay as their allies or we could enforce our law, a situation which could lead to even more riots and dissent...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL34.T;Riot of Avignon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL35.T;The Occitan problem;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL35.D;We were happy when the Valois were removed from their throne in Tolon but we might face growing problems in our Southern provinces because of the Occitan Republic proclaimed by the Etrurians. The Republic is still disorganized, as the Avignon riots proved so it might be easy to annex Provence without complications...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL36.T;An Anglois proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL36.D;The Dual-Monarchy has been alarmed by the creation of the Occitan Republic and they have let us know that they would like our Foreign Minister to go to Lyon where we could negotiate what we'd gain in exchange of letting Marseille on its own ...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL37.T;Deal with the Devil;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL37.D;The Etrurians have accepted to let us deal with Marseille as we please in exchange of a promise of non-intervention in Italy, should Etruria be in a position to unify the Peninsula.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL38.T;Deal with the Devil;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL38.D;We have betrayed the Occitan but in exchange gained a promise of non-intervention by the Anglois government. Let us hope it will serve us...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL39.T;The Anglois threat;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL39.D;We have been left on our own by Florence! Anglois armies have assembled and sent us an ultimatum demanding our immediate surrender!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL40.T;Response from Marseilles;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL40.D;The Occitan won't back down. What we won't get by diplomacy, we'll get it by war!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL41.T;Anglois ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VAL41.D;The Anglois government has decided to erase the Occitan republic from the map! Now we must choose, either to fight in an already-lost war or leave and appear as cowards!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
JAP.20T;Nanshin-Ron;;;;;;;;;;;;x
JAP.20D;The Ming dynasty has failed to reclaim the Mandate of Heaven and is now isolated on the island of Takasogu Koku. It is our duty to end their petty rule on the island and integrate it into our country as a model colony. It will be the first step in our Southern Expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

JAP23.D;We have acquired the rich Northern Tagalog islands in the South but our rule is challenged by the tribal kingdom of Tondo. It is time we end their independence and add them to our colonies!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
JAP24.T;Claiming the Pacific islands;;;;;;;;;;;;x
JAP24.D;The Bonin islands are too close of the Home Islands to be let in the hands of the gaijin. With our navy reknowned in these seas our claim will easily be recognized!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

accepting_caribenos_title;The Caribenos;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accepting_caribenos_desc;The island of Kuba has seen the local settlers develop differently from both the Colombians and the Spanish. The island being in the center of the Caribbean Sea has seen countless traders land in Habana and Santiago and the local plantations are still profitable. Thus it could be easy to ensure our rule on the island by recognizing some autonomy and make the locals accept our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Western_border_treaty_title;Push to the West;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Western_border_treaty_desc;The unification of Arcadia has led to a great increase of immigrants arriving in our ports. The tension between the former hostile communities of the continent is not helping the new people to integrate efficiently in our country. Thus it was proposed to claim all territories which are currently not fully settled by the Sanbao government in exchange of a generous subsidy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC3.D;Qingqiu has refused to give up their territories!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC3.T;Refusal of Sanbao;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC2.D;The Arcadian star is growing like no ever state did in the New-World. The influx of migrants is impressive and they have offered to buy at a reasonable price all the territories we possess in the Rockies. It would be sad to give up all this territory we have acquired at the cost of many lives but can we face the full might of Arcadia ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC2.T;Abandoning our new territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC1.D;With out claims fully staked we can now ask Sanbao to relinquish all of our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC1.T;Claiming the Rocky Mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC4.T;The treaty of Sanbao;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC4.D;The Qingqiuan government has accepted the proposal of the Arcadian government and has relinquished all their claims outside their core territories on the West Coast of Arcadia. Many hope it will be sufficient to stop the greed for land of the new continental power...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Takikawa_title;Advancing into Arcadia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Takikawa_desc;The Kaiganese colony has always claimed the remote Takikawa region as her rightful lands and with Odensmark and Tangwan falling under the control of other powers it might be wise move to take this region too.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Takikawa_2_title;The Great North;;;;;;;;;;;;x
Takikawa_2_desc;The remote area of Takikawa was discovered by the Kaiganese at the beginning of the century but its remoteness and lack of ressources has left it empty. But now that all nearby territories are colonized it might be better for us to settle that territory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC5.T;Status of Xiazhou;;;;;;;;;;;;x
DNGARC5.D;Even if Sanbao signed the treaty it does not mean they accepted the loss of their northern states and the local community reminds us of it everyday.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCMEX1.T;The treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCMEX1.D;Arcadia was formed with Lusitania and they have claimed the whole old viceroyalty as an intgral part of their country. But many Spanish-speaking people are living the southern regions and our government has claimed them for quite a long time. Maybe it's time we let go these claims?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCMEX2.T;Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARCMEX2.D;Arcadian diplomacy strikes another success as the government of Mexico accepted to relinquish their claims on Lusitania! It might be the beginning of a new era in Mexican-Arcadian relations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TAR1.T;War in the steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR1.D;The vicious Muscovians are upon us! We must mobilize every men to fight back and keep the Russians out of the steppe!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR2.T;Weakening Moscow;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR2.D;The Tsardom of Moscow is the fierciest rival of our Republic and they have invaded us too many times to remember. Despite the clauses of the peace of Prague they have decided to attack the Tatar khanates. We don't support the Tatars and we haven't forgotten the devastation they brought to Mother Russia but we can't let Moscow expand too much south. The knyaz has recommended to ask Copenhagen before any actions but perhaps it might be wiser to not do a thing at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR3.T;The Muscovian threat;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR3.D;Muscovy has been a thorn in the side of our Kingdom for much of the past centuries. The Republic of Novgorod, under our protection has asked us to help them in a puniive expedition aimed at weakening the Tsardom which is expanding in the Steppe. While it would be costly, it might be necessary in the long-term if we want to keep our influence in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR4.T;Scandinavian support;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR4.D;Our allies and protectors have lent us support in our enterprise. The Armies of the Republic shall march through Moscow!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR5.T;Scandinavian refusal;;;;;;;;;;;;x

TAR10.T;The Succession of Selim III;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR10.D;The problem of succession has plagued the various khanates of the steppe since their creation. Even Crimea, the most civilized of them does not escape this rule. Most of the time the question was ruled out by the Ottomans who chose woever pleased them the most. Selim III is aging and he has two sons fighting for the throne. Selim is like his father, traditional and afraid of the changes of the West. Murad is his opposite : he went to study in Istanbul where he became a reknowned scholar, even meeting the future king of Iraq and becoming an acquaintance of his. He then fought on the side of the Reformers in the Ottoman Civil War and now with the influence of Constantinople shrieking in the Black Sea, he has decided to come back. Selim has began to plot the death of his brother and who knows how it will end...;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR11.T;Murad II;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR11.D;The Khan is dead, long live the Khan! Murad II, the reknowned general and scholar has succeeded in exiling his borther and taking the throne. he has promised to end obscurantism in the Khanate and restore the rightful place of the Tatars in the Steppe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR12.T;Adoption of the Latin alphabet;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR12.D;Out of the many reforms adopted by Murad II, the codification of Crimean Tatar language is often seen as one of his most important legacy. At his demand, many thinkers and scholars gathered to standardize the language and write it using the Latin Alphabet. It soon boosted the literacy of the people and helped the students to more easily learn the knowledges of the Western World.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR13.T;The end of raids;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR13.D;Raiding was the main activity of Crimea for centuries, the warriors of the steppes clashing with Polish, Moldavian, Russian and most of all Cossack forces in the open steppe of the Dniepr and the Don. Murad II decided to impose an edict forbidding raids in foreign countries. it was one of his many efforts to make the West acknowledge him as a civilized and also a great step towards the settlement of the nomad population of Crimea.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR14.T;The unification of the Steppe;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR14.D;For far too long the Steppe warriors have clashed with each others instead of unite against their common foes. Murad II is decided to end the decay of the former Great Horde and he has seen how weak is the Astrakhan Khanate. Will he take the chance to force the Astrakhani bow before him or will he continue the modernization of his own Khanate ?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR15.T;Conquest of Nogai;;;;;;;;;;;;x
TAR15D;Astrakhan has fallen and now only the Nogai Khanate resists the might of Crimea. It is time to end the division of the Steppe peoples and create the state of Tatarstan!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ITASOC.T;Socialism;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ITASOC.D;Italian politics have seen the rise of a new political movement : the Socialists. Inspired by the ideas of the Revolution this young movement has pledged to protect the people from its oppressors and press for more rights for the workers. Already similar movements have arisen throughout Europe and others civilized nations and their support of the masses could see a shif in politics. Inspired by their endeavour a young German called Marx has published the Communist Manifesto, which is already seen by some circles as the ideological pillar of the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME123111;Grossdeutschland;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC123111;Germany is now fully unifed but the problem of Bohemia is still there. Prague sits in the middle of the German lands and the hardcore nationalists call for the same treatment that the German nation received from Prague with the total occupation of the country. They are a minority, most of the complaints being about Silesia. The densely populated and industrialized region has many Germans around Breslau and Lower Silesia, making part of the Greater German Nation. Some also call for the annexation of whole Silesia, but most of the territories in the South are populated by Poles and Czechs. A pacifist minority call for a new era of relations with Bohemia with no reclamation of territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

334205.D;The traitorous Ming has been vanquished, his attempt at regaining the momentum crushed by our armies! We must now decide what will happen to our state : the Regency of Jiangsu was established by the prominent men of the Jiangsu area following the Fall of the Southern Ming to protect the interests of the province against the foreign Manchus and the fanatical Taiping. The oligarchy endured for more than a hundred years but now we stand at a crossroad : the ambitious general who was granted extraordinary powers for the duration of the war could proclaim himself Emperor with the support of the Army, the old oligarchy could restore the previous status quo or democrats could end the ambiguity and create the First Chinese Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME135103;The Dahomey Amazons;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135103;The Dahomey Amazons were originally established as a group of female elephant hunters in the 17th century by King Houegbadja, in the early 18th century his son, King Agaja, made them into the bodyguards of the king, armed with muskets. According to tradition, Agaja also developed them into a militia that helped win a war against the Kingdom of Savi. What their job in the army always has been is just to hold banners to make the army seem bigger than it actually is, however some suggest that we might make even better use of them if they were turned into an actual female corp that'd fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135104;Ideas of Absolutism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135104;The idea of an absolute monarch being able to rule better than a feudal one is spreading throughout the kingdom, although not widespread it continues to be more and more popular. They are taking the European states and some of our neighbors as proof of absolutism being better, seeing as many of them seem to be more successful. Maybe we can capitalize on this and abolish the stubborn tribes of our Kingdom?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135105;Slave Market Failing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135105;The market for slavery is doing worse and worse everyday, people don't want to buy new ones and instead try to sell their old ones. Some of the reasons for this are that slaves have demanded more and more rights under the years and you now have the responsability of taking care of your slaves well being aswell as many slave revolts in the Kingdom resulting in several owners killed. The advisers are trying to come up with ideas with how we can fix this problem, but so far the only options we seem to have are either loosening the restrictions on owning a slave and encouraging slavery amongst the farms or just completely abolish slavery as many consider it unethical aswell as it not being very benefitial for the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135106;The Culture of Dahomey;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135106;The culture in Dahomey has always been very distinct from elsewhere in Africa. Much of the arts are subsidized by the royal family and the artists aren't of any specific class, but instead can be created by anyone from a lord to a peasant. One of the many things that make our country so great is the Royal Palaces of Abomey which are several palaces spread over a large complex, every palace contains stone carvings depicting the many accomplishments of the king and every king had his own palace. There are two unique aspects of art in Dahomey, firstly it's the assembling of different components, using many different materials, and secondly it's the borrowing of culture from neighboring people. Some say our focus should lie in developing our own culture, but many are also intrigued by the cultures of the outside world. We could either focus on and subsidize our own local culture and develop it or we could embrace some of the western ideas in hopes of becoming more like them or we could embrace some of our islamic neighbors' traditions and learn from them instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME135107;A Backward Country;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC135107;While there's no doubt that our country is great and beautiful it is no lie that we are behind many other countries in the region, especially the European nations on the coast. We must combat this by developing our own country into something it couldn't even imagine a few generations ago. One of the biggest reasons the Europeans, and some of our neighbors, are so ahead is their academia, their's are much larger than ours. To be able to transform into a developed country we must increase it, however we're not completely sure of what the best way of doing do would be. Some say educating the people is the best way, just look at the literacy rate in Europe, while some say that we should just further educate what we have and refine it into an elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

build_the_ponte_liberta_desc;Venice has benefited from most of its history of being an island.

VEN1.D;Our intervention in Greece some years allowed us to secure mainland Greece, greatly enhancing our position among the Mediterranean powers. The Turkish Civil War is not yet over and the islands of the Aegean seem ripe for the conquest. The delicescent state of the Sultanate allows us such actions without actions from other powers and we have the support of some local Greek nationalist cells to help us. The most daring of our strateges have suggested that we could try to seize the port of Izmir which is populated by many Greek but such an action would certainly mean an Ottoman reaction;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VEN7.T;The Most Serene Republic of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN7.D;The Republic of Venice has endured as an oligarchic institution since its beginnings and the government is now incredibly complicated to form with many offices separated to avoid concentration of power. As a result there has not been tyranny in the Republic but it is also a static institution that has a hard time evolving with the current times. The Doges for example are now only an honorific post with little power, despite being the Head of State from their election to their death. An election requires a lot of draws to designate the candidates and the votes needed a significant majority to work. This prestige position is currently held by the former admiral Silvestro Dandolo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN8.T;The death of the Doge;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN8.D;Silvestro Dandolo died yesterday in the Palace of the Doges at the honorable age of 81. He was a major actor in the Venetian intervention in Greece, even going to Athens after the truce to ciment Venetian hold on Greece. He was less active during the recent years because of his old age but he managed to make acceptable some reforms of the Doge's election.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN9.T;Election of the 122th Doge of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN9.D;The election of the Doge has seen the opposition between Reformers and Conservatives erupt in open day, with three men being plausible candidates. Daniele Manin, not related to the 120th Doge, is a Liberal jurist known for being one of the heads of the Reformaters faction. Opposing him is ANtonio Salviati, a conservative noble known for his interest in industry and in maintaining the status quo. Outside those two polarized figures is Giovanni Battista Giuseppe Albrizzi, son of the Greek poetess Isabella Albrizzi, a neutral candidate known for his taste in art and literature, and also a known philhellen. The election will be seen as a sign toward the crowds of the Republic, one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VEN11.D;Antonio Salviati, the 122th Doge of Venice has died yesterday in the Palace of the Doges.

VEN12.T;Death of Giovanni Albrizzi;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN12.D;Giovanni Albrizzi, the 122th Doge of Venice has died yesterday in the Giardini where an art exposition was held. A known sponsor of the arts, he funded several artists throughout his office, not taking part in politics, and often acting as an eccentric character.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN13.T;The election of the 123th Doge of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VEN13.D;This election is historic because of the reforms underwent in the previous years. The Doge will be elected by the whole electorate after the process of selection has been made. Three candidates have arisen. The Conservatives support Pietro Bertolini, an important official in the Stato da Mar and colonial governor. The Liberals have supported Alessandro Guicciolli, a reknown diplomat who has gone through the various capitals of Europe to represent the Republic. Meanwhile the Socialists support the eccentric Filipo Grimani, a devout Christian supporting the Socialists in their efforts of establishing a juster society. Let the people cast their vote!;;;;;;;;;;;;x

The city was never really planned and the feudality system that endured here for centuries has led to a poor development. Outside of the Royal Castle and the Alfredian place in the harbor there is a lot of work to do to ensure that Camelot can continue the legacy of the Arthurian legend and grow to be one of the best cities of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC232000000;I saw, about four miles to the left, a sheet of water, which ultimately proved to be a creek and the southernmost part of what the Arabs call the Ukerewe Sea. Convinced that I finally found the source of the Nile, I went down a grassy and jungly depression into a deep, dirty, viscid nullah, which communicated with the southern end of the creek, which we named Jordan. As we followed the creek, that increased in breadth as it extended northwards, we saw many little islands in Ukerewe, well wooded, standing boldly out of the water. The journey continued through another tortuous day until we reached the village of Isamiro, where the view was clearer and better. In the distant horizon a calm sea line started to appear between north and west. Even in a well known country the view would have attracted attention for its placid beauty, he thought to himself. He felt he had solved the great old riddle.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

GRE92.D;Following Greek independence from Venice the Orthodox Church, which had played a great role in the independence process began a great revival movement, often at the expanse of the state which didn't look at it in a good way. Wandering monks taught common people to read the Bible, seminaries were opened to instruct priests in the ways of the faith and new synods were held. Overall it helped improve literacy but the Church became more powerful, often opposing the new Enlightenment ideas that Venice had helped spread in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
