AMA1.T;La Rive Gauche;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA1.D;The Para region which controls the west bank of the Amazon river has been under Spanish domination for decades. However it is a backward place where nobody lives except the local tribes and some Guianan outposts. Settlers from the Equinoxian Republic have begun inhabiting the region and are advancing more every day. We could take advantage of the current war to seize Para and annex it to Equinoxia. However we should be aware that when the war ends, the victor could come back reclaiming these lands ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98401.A;Take the opportunity while no one is watching;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98401.B;It is not our territory, call them back !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA2.T;Message from Para;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA2.D;The Amazonian settlers have seized the entirety of the Para area !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98402.A;The bastards !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA3.T;Para ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA3.D;My king, one matter has come to the attention of our councillors. The region of Para was nominally under our protection for decades but the Amazonian settlers have profited from the war to seize it. It is worthless lands ans swamps but by principle we should ask a compensation. We could threaten to go to war or ask a monetary compensation to finance our war debts ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98403.A;We will settle the matter if they pay us;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98403.B;Send this message : 'Para or War' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98403.C;Why bother about some inhospitable jungle ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA4.T;Spanish envoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA4.D;The Spanish delegates have approached us about our seizure of Para. They are willing to drop the matter if we pay them "reparations" on a 12year basis. What do we do ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98404.A;Just some money ? Take the chance while they are asking !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98404.B;And what will they do if we don't ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA5.T;Amazonian Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA5.D;The Amazonian have accepted. The first payment is fulfilled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98405.A;I think we have made a great deal gentlemen;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA6.T;Amazonian Response ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA6.D;The Amazonian have refused to pay reparations. There is only one solution : war. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98406.A;They want war ? They'll get war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA7.T;Second payment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA7.D;It is the time to pay our "reparations" to Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;

AMA11.D;Amazonie has paid all the reparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98411.A;It was good while it lasted;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA12.T;Spanish Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA12.D;The Spanish government has asked us to relinquish our control of Para. Should we choose not to give it up, it will mean war ....;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98412.A;We don't have a lot of choices ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98412.B;Let them come !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA13.T;Para regained;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA13.D;Amazonie has bowed before our demands !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98413.A;Glory to Espana !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA14.T;Para ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA14.D;While we were rejoicing over our total victory over the insurgents, some our councillors have reminded us of Para. The region of Para was nominally under our protection for decades but the Amazonian settlers have profited from the war to seize it. It is worthless lands ans swamps but by principle we should ask a compensation. We could threaten to go to war or ask a monetary compensation to finance our war debts ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;

98414.C;Why bother about some inhospitable jungle ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA15.T;Amazonian crimes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA15.D;We have faced many hardships : we vainquished Spain definitely and proved to the world that we stand united and it is now time to settle the conflict with Amazonia. They seized Para during the war, thinking no one would try to take it but they are wrong, we did not forget and foremost, we didn't forgive. We can ask them to give up the area or we could settle for some monetary "reparations";;;;;;;;;;;;;
98415.A;We will settle the matter if they pay us;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98415.B;Send this message : 'Para or War' ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98415.C;Why bother about some inhospitable jungle ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA16.T;Colombian envoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA16.D;The Colombian delegates have approached us about our seizure of Para. They are willing to drop the matter if we pay them "reparations" on a 12year basis. What do we do ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98416.A;Just some money ? Take the chance while they are asking !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98416.B;And what will they do if we don't ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

98425.A;Glory to Gran Columbia !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA26.T;Chaos in the Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA26.D;The loss of Atlantia has created a great distrust between the government and the military, the latter accusing the former of having betrayed them and that victory was near. A circle of officer has decided to end the democratic rabble and plan to take the Parliament by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98426.A;The military take control of the Parliament;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98426.B;The government vanquishes the high-command;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA27.T;Talks of secession in Equinoxia ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA27.D;The Equinoxian republic has always been distinct inside the Federation and also one of the most democratic. The end of the democracy in Amazonia has made some Equinoxian think about secession and it seems their movement spread to Vaura ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98427.A;We'll have to watch them closely ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA28.T;The Cappadocian Revolution !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA28.D;The Equinoxian patriots have risen against the government decided to leave the Federation to create their own democratic state !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98428.A;We will crush them !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA29.T;Seizure of Port-Liberté;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA29.D;With the capture of the military commandment, the war has been declared null and void. The Equinoxian leader has proclaimed the Federation and reestablished the Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98429.A;We shall reestablish democracy in Amazonia ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA30.T;End of the Civil War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA30.D;With the last strongholds taken by our forces, Amazonia is once again one and indivisible !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98430.A;We are united once again ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA31.T;The return of the king ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA31.D;Many in the military are supporters of a monarchy in Amazonia. Should we start looking for a monarch ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98431.A;It is time for the return of the king. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98431.B;We are fine as we are thanks ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA32.T;Homeland or New World ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA32.D;Two possible monarchs were found. The Duke of Brittany and the duke of Leonie. Choosing one will also guide our external policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98432.A;The duke of Brittany will become king ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98432.B;The duke of Leonie will become king;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA33.T;The Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
AMA33.D;The new monarch must choose how he will rule (or not).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98433.A;The military knows best how to rule this country;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98433.B;Some reforms are needed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98433.C;The king reigns but does not rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup5name;Beornian-Lotharian summit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup5desc;With the inauguration of Edward IV's statue in Fort Lothar, we see an opportunity to bring Beornia and Lotharingia even closer. We could invite King Edward for a summit to cement our friendship for the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup5opt1;We can only gain from this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup5opt2;This is not really necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup1name;Lotharingia calls for Summit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup1desc;Lotharingia has paid tribute to our king Edward IV in their capital, Fort Lothere. Seeing as a fit opportunity, they called for a meeting with our government and our king, and presented us with the possibility of a friendship agreement. We could benefit a lot from their alliance, but we must consider well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup1opt1;Beornians and Lotharians have always be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup1opt2;While they are ouf friends, we have our divides.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup1opt3;Attend the summit, but keep our distance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup2name;Beornian-Lotharian summit a success!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup2desc;The tribute to King Edward IV has gone smoothly, and the summit was a success. Our friends in the south have accepted our proposal of a friendship agreement. Let the world know we are brothers, and Ameriga tremble before our power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
775401.A;YES!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup3name;Beornian-Lotharian summit stalled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup3desc;The tribute to King Edward IV was appreciated and the summit was amiable, but in the end there were differences that still kept us apart. And alliance was signed, but nothing further than that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
775402.A;Well, damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup4name;Our approach has failed!.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipsetup4desc;The tribute to King Edward IV was appreciated, but the Beornian delegation was uninterested in further commitment towards an alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
775403.A;So much potential wasted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipevent1name;Beornian relations are cooling;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipevent1desc;Our relations with Beornia have been cooling for some time. By evoking our Friendship agreement, we can come closer again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipevent1opt1;Do it immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipevent1opt2;Try talking to their ambassador, but there's no need for a fuss over this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipevent1opt3;In fact, we rather let them cool down a bit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LOTNANfriendshipevent1opt4;This non-sense has gone too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

LOTNANfriendshipevent3desc;For too long, our nations have grown apart from our friendship. Now it is time we accept the divide between us is too big to heal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97086;Pacification of $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97086;Through the judicious use of force, confiscation of native lands and the introduction of roads and other vestiges of civilization, conditions in $PROVINCENAME$ have greatly improved. The native patagonians are proving to be contentious, but their numbers are far too few for us to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97086.A;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ameriga3.T;Exploration of the Amazonas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ameriga3.D;Our forces have occupied more of the lands in the Amazonas. The pacification of the local natives is ongoing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97087.A;Good;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ameriga4.T;Amazonian Destiny;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ameriga4.D;The partisans of Amazonian expansionnism are divided into three camps. First are those who only want to annex the border states near la Cote du Café. But some are also wanting to take all lands where Guarani people inhabit and integrate them into our society to balance the power of the Lotharians in the area. And eventually a fringe minority calls for the complete annexation of Lotharingia to form a greater Amerigan Federation. But should we declare such an ambition, the greater powers would surely act against us ....;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97090.A;We will only take the states along our border;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97090.B;We will free the Guaranis;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ameriga8.T;The Question of Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ameriga8.D;With the reconquest of Atlantia, some people are beginning to argue about the benevolent rule of Denis d'Aigle. Our president has now announced that he will be making a speech to answer the question of the nature of our government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97094.A;Denis d'Aigle will continue to lead us as he always did !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97094.B;Denis d'Aigle will call new elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97094.C;What Lotharingia needs is a strong monarch. D'Aigle will be crowned Denis Ier;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Ameriga14.T;An Amerigan Proposition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ameriga14.D;Representatives from the Amerigan State have arrived to our capital to discuss the integration of Beornia into their state. We have had ties with the Lotharians for centuries and should we refuse it is likely they will invade us anyway.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
775411.A;We will join the Federation ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
775411.B;They can go to hell with their Federation !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
Ameriga15.T;Positive Response;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97090;The Argentina-Chile Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97090;Now that the lands of Araucania and Patagonia are fully settled, the Argentinians have approached us to work out a border treaty. They intend to claim the lands east of the Andes and are willing to concede the lands east of the Andes to us. If we do not come to an agreement, future conflict is almost guaranteed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME333001;Scramble for Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC333001;The Scramble for Africa, also known as the Race for Africa was a process of invasion, attack, occupation, and annexation of African territory by Great Powers of the civilzed world during the New Imperialism period during the end of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. As a result of the heightened tension between European states in the last quarter of the 19th century, the partitioning of Africa may be seen as a way for the Europeans to eliminate the threat of a Europe-wide war over Africa. Popular European ideas in the 19th century also aided the partitioning of Africa. The eugenics movement and Imperialism helped to foster the expansionist policy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME333000;Our Western Overlords;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC333000;During the New Imperialism period, by the end of the century, Europe added almost 9,000,000 square miles (23,000,000 square kilometres) – one-fifth of the land area of the globe – to its overseas colonial possessions. Our master decided that our territory should be added to this area as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC333004;The Europeans who settled Waka o Aoraki sent an envoy to our chiefs. They claim that they want to bring peace and prosperity to our lands.

EVTNAME201036;The Tower of Babel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201036;Meticulous research and aerial photography leave no doubt: Babylon, once only a legend of power and decadence out of Biblical tales, is now an established archaeological site. The Hanging Gardens of Semiramis and a large palace complex have been found and carefully examined. Archives filled with clay tablets have been unearthed and translated. But the most prestigious find was the discovery by a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist that even the legend of the Tower of Babel has an historical basis. A massive unfinished ziggurat has been found, larger by far than any yet known. This is an unforgettable day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

It is clear that the Inca were wealthier and more culturally sophisticated than was previously suspected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
201071.A;Stunning!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201072;The Golden Raft;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201072;After all the careful exploration of major Inca sites, the most dramatic breakthrough yet has come from a farming village. A ceramic vessel was unearthed, and inside was a breathtaking golden sculpture of an early Inca chief on a log raft, surrounded by priests and servants. Comparing the sculpture with frescoes from the temples and regional legends, we now believe that the chief painted himself with gold dust and leapt into a mountain lake to make offerings to appease the gods. It seems likely that this ritual is the ancient origin of the legend of "Golden Kings" that so tantalized Spanish explorers centuries ago. What a triumph for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most of the knowledge about the mountain has been lost during the Spanish conquest and the few inscriptions we have tell us that it was Pachacuti himself who chose the site to be one of his residences. We have also found a great temple dedicated to Inti in the ruins and the priests of the Empire have asked that they be given the site to build a great sanctuary to honour Inti and the past Incas. The site would also be a magnificent retreat for our sovereigns if we renovated the whole place. Also the European advisers of our court have expressed their interest in funding missions to study this example of our old Civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

While this would have economic benefits for $COUNTRY$, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ negotiators have been incredibly aggressive-- and the terms they offer are almost insulting.

EVTDESC2510;The SS $CAPITAL$, a small military steamer, mysteriously sank yesterday while on port call in a foreign harbor, following a massive explosion on the starboard midship. Military Intelligence suggests that the explosion may have been caused by an overheated boiler, but the widely circulated scandal press, taking its usual liberties with truth in favor of expediency, has already seized the opportunity and are calling the explosion an act of sabotage and aggression by a foreign power. Our citizens are in ire over the affair, and calls for foreign blood to be spilled can be heard echoing on the streets of $CAPITAL$, the ships' namesake.;Alors qu'il faisait escale dans un port étranger, le navire $CAPITAL$, un petit steamer militaire, a mystérieusement coulé hier à la suite d'une énorme explosion sur tribord. Les renseignements indiquent que l'explosion peut avoir été provoquée par la surchauffe d'une chaudière, mais la presse à scandale, et les libertés très controversées dont elle s'affuble, a profité de l'occasion et mis en avant la thèse du sabotage et de l'agression par une puissance étrangère. Cette affaire suscite la plus vive colère de nos concitoyens et des appels aux représailles résonnent dans les rues de $CAPITAL$, qui a donné son nom au navire.;Die SS $CAPITAL$, ein kleiner Militärdampfer, ist gestern in einem ausländischen Hafen unter mysteriösen Umständen nach einer Explosion gesunken. Die Militäraufklärung vermutet hinter der Explosion einen überhitzten Heizkessel, aber die Skandalpresse nimmt sich ihre üblichen Freiheiten und hat die Explosion bereits als Sabotageakt und Aggression einer ausländischen Macht bezeichnet. Unsere Bürger sind wegen der Angelegenheit verärgert, und auf den Straßen von $CAPITAL$, Namensgeber des Schiffes, wird das Vergießen ausländischen Blutes gefordert.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2520;Our ambassador to one of the other great powers has telegraphed home expressing his frustration with the response, or rather, lack of it, that he has received while trying to settle a bilateral extradition treaty with the country in question. Apparently our ambassador has been snubbed repeatedly by this foreign administration, and has been delegated to speaking to civil servants instead of being allowed direct access to the country's decision makers. This diplomatic back-and-forth has been going on for two months.;Notre ambassadeur en poste dans l'une des autres grandes puissances nous a adressé un message pour exprimer la frustration suscitée par la réponse, ou plus exactement l'absence de réponse, qu'il a reçue alors qu'il tentait de conclure un traité d'extradition bilatérale avec le pays en question. Apparemment, notre ambassadeur a été plusieurs fois remis à sa place par cette administration étrangère et s'est vu reléguer au rang d'interlocuteur des fonctionnaires, avec impossibilité de s'adresser directement aux décideur du pays. Ce va-et-vient diplomatique dure depuis deux mois.;Unser Botschafter in einer der anderen Großmächte hat uns ein Telegramm geschickt, in dem er seine Frustration bezüglich der ausbleibenden Antwort auf seine Bemühungen nach einem bilateralen Auslieferungsvertrag mit dem fraglichen Land zum Ausdruck gebracht hat. Anscheinend ist unser Botschafter vom Außenministerium dieses Landes mehrfach brüskiert worden und musste mit Beamten sprechen anstatt Zugang zu den Entscheidungsträgern zu bekommen.

EVTNAME2530;Colonial Incident;Incident colonial;Kolonialzwischenfall;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2530;A colonial regiment in one of our colonies has had an encounter with a regiment from another colonial power, which had, according to a military report, crossed into our colonial claim on an obscure waterway a fair distance into the colony's hinterland. The report further goes on to state that this foreign regiment was, when encountered by our patrol, in the process of conducting a geological survey of the area, the object of which is as of yet unknown to us. Hawkish members of our war cabinet see this as a direct assault on $COUNTRY$'s territorial integrity, and call for the execution of a plan they have termed, quite simply, 'Operation $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fury'.;"Un régiment colonial de l'une de nos colonies s'est heurté à un régiment d'une autre puissance coloniale qui avait, selon un rapport militaire, accédé à notre territoire par un obscur cours d'eau avant de gagner l'arrière-pays de la colonie. Ce rapport indique, en outre, qu'au moment de son interception, ce régiment effectuait un relèvement géologique de la région dont nous ignorons les réelles motivations. Des membres bellicistes de notre cabinet de guerre y voient là une attaque directe contre l'intégrité territoriale de $COUNTRY$ et en appelle à l'exécution d'un plan qu'ils ont tout simplement appelé ""Opération Fureur $COUNTRY_ADJ$"".";In einer unserer Kolonien ist eines unserer Kolonialregimenter auf ein Regiment einer anderen Kolonialmacht getroffen, das unseren Anspruch auf eine unbekannte Wasserstraße weit im Hinterland der Kolonie bestreitet. Der Bericht sagt weiter aus, dass dieses ausländische Regiment wohl geologische Untersuchungen im Gebiet unternahm, als es von unserer Patrouille gestellt wurde. Was es untersucht hat, ist noch unbekannt. Militaristische Mitglieder unseres Kabinetts sehen dies als direkten Angriff auf die territoriale Integrität von $COUNTRY$, und fordern die Ausführung eines Plans, den sie offensichtlich schon seit einiger Zeit in der Schublade haben: 'Operation $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Wut'.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2540;On this subject I would like to bring up the issue of a merchant, operating out of one of my constituencies, who wrote to me last month with a most distressing story of how trade goods of his had been seized by customs officials in a foreign port. Again, I can only reiterate that further tolerance of these abridgments of the unrestricted freedom of international trade will only serve to compound the problem further with every year that passes.'\n\nAn MP known for his ardent support of free trade has held a speech in parliament today, detailing grievances against a foreign power.;"Sur ce sujet, j'aimerais attirer votre attention sur le fait qu'un marchand, opérant hors d'une de mes circonscriptions, m'a adressé un courrier le mois dernier, courrier dans lequel il m'expliquait comment ses marchandises avaient été saisies par les fonctionnaires des douanes d'un port étranger. Là encore, je ne peux que répéter qu'une tolérance accrue face à de tels agissements contraires au libre échange international ne ferait qu'accentuer, au fil des années, le problème"".\nUn membre du parlement, fervent défenseur du libre échange, a tenu un discours au parlement, aujourd'hui, pour dresser la liste des griefs à l'encontre d'une puissance étrangère.";Bezüglich dieses Themas würde ich gerne von einem Händler berichten, der sein Geschäft aus einem meiner Wahlkreise betreibt: Letzten Monat schrieb er mir, dass seine Güter von den Zollbehörden in einem ausländischen Hafen konfisziert worden waren. Das ist höchst beunruhigend. Deshalb kann ich nur wiederholen, dass die weitere Toleranz dieser Verletzungen der internationalen Handelsfreiheit das Problem mit jedem Jahr, das vergeht, nur noch vergrößern.'\n\nEin Parlamentsmitglied, das für seine Brandreden berüchtigt ist, hat heute vor dem Parlament gesprochen und seinen Groll gegen eine ausländische Macht genau beschrieben .;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME2600;$STATENAME$ Integration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2600;$COUNTRY$ has maintained control over $STATENAME$ for us to consider the possibility of integrating it into $COUNTRY$ as a whole. There are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags waving in $PROVINCENAME$, flown by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, so it does not seem so far-fetched an idea that $STATENAME$ be eventually considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory by the world at large.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2600.A;We should begin integrating $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2600.B;Let $STATENAME$ remain separate, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

2601.D;There is no longer a need to justify a claim in $STATENAME$, since it already exists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2601.A;So be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2605;$PROVINCENAME$ Integrated into $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2605;$COUNTRY$ has controlled $PROVINCENAME$ for a long time-- long enough for those within $PROVINCENAME$ to truly consider themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and for the rest of the world to consider the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ claim to the province to be legitimate as well. Though there are still some unhappy with the development, $PROVINCENAME$ is now considered an integral part of $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2605.A;Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2610;$STATENAME$ Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2610;$STATENAME$ is considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory-- that is only in dispute by those neighbours who still have recognized claims on the area, and who maintain that many within $STATENAME$ consider themselves citizens of their country and not ours. The first step in rendering their claim invalid would be to enact a policy that encourages the assimilation of all people within $STATENAME$... they should be $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens, and hold no other nationality above ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2610.A;Begin assimilating $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2610.B;This will only cause more conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME2611;Assimilation Policies Rescinded;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2611;With the new government in power and its more liberal views on minorities within $COUNTRY$, the policies of assimilation that attempted to stamp out minorities of other nationalities have all been rescinded. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ military who warn that this is a dangerous idea, and that allowing these foreign identities to perpetuate will only lead to further conflict with our neighbours-- but, for now, their voices have been ignored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2615;A demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them-- a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$.

EVTNAME2616;Incident in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC2616;The recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbours with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least-- riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC2620;A parade has recently taken place in $PROVINCENAME$, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag flying high-- and being held by people who, until very recently, likely wouldn't have considered themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens at all. $PROVINCENAME$ is still claimed by another country, but the acceptance of $PROVINCENAME$'s people is going a long way towards making elimination of that an inevitable fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DZG1.D;The Khanate of Dzungaria is the last great remnant of the Mongolian Empire. Founded by OIrat Mongol in the XVIIth century it grew in importance in the following century unifying the Mongolian camps and vainquishing the Qing during several campaigns. It is said that it’s thanks to the Oirat that China is not dominated by the Manchu. The actual Khan, Galdan converted to Islam following his conquests of Samarkand and khiva but has shown tolerance towards the Buddhists lamas of his realm.

DZG2.D;Galdan Khan, the supreme chief of the Asian steppe died yesterday at the venerable age of 76 years. The size of the Khanate combined with the ambitions of his sons has seen the Empire already divided, each army pledging an oath to a different son. The heir Tushiyetu has seized the crown lands of Dzungaria but he now must choose : will he try to stop his brothers’ ambition or will he completely let the Empire disrupt ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DZG23.T;The question of script;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DZG23.D;The National Library of Urumqi is filling with books since our investment! But our scholars have asked ourselves which script we should use for the translation of foreign books into our language. Central Asia has been using plenty of ways of writing : Muslim elites often use Arabic, merchants used Chinese, monks use Tibetan... A Mongol script was created by Genghis Khan and is still enduring. We could also adapt the Latin alphabet to our needs and become closer to the Western World or promulgate Arabic to please the Muslim populations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DZG8.T;Coming back from the West.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DZG8.D;Our expedition has eventually come back from the West! They have brought with them limitless knowledge on politics, science and war. They have also established contact with most of the khans of Europe, who for most of them did not know the existence of our glorious country! To serve as military advisers they have also hired ‘Cossacks’, great warriors from the Western Steppes they claim. Their leader the Baron Roman Stroganov-Romanov, a disinherited noble has made a great impression to the Khan but he seems to be an ambitious man, full of eccentricities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CLM1.T; The reorganization of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM1.D; Now we have defeated the rebels we have to decide how we shall administer this vast territory. Some are in favor of keeping the Colombians under our rule but it will cost us tremendous amounts of money to successfully rule the area. Most are proposing home rule. Some propose to reestablish the vice-royalties of Lusitania, Mexico and Granada along with the Capitancy-General of Greater Salvador. However we could also dislocate the Granadan territory between a colony around Cartagena, establishing a new Capitancy in Essequibo and giving the rest of Tierra Firme to a Castillian vice-royalty around Caracas. The Andes provinces would be divided between Arequipa and Quito and to avoid a strong Mexico we would separate Jalisco. The choice is the hands of the king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46447.A;Keeping them under our surveillance is the best thing to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46447.B;Restore the vice-royalties;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46447.C;Divide the old vice-royalties;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLMcusco.T;The question of Cuzco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLMcusco.D;The old imperial city of the Incan Empire is in our hands since the end of the rebellion. Cuzco has been under our control since 1575 but the area is still predominantly inhabited by Quechua people and few have adopted our customs. Some in our government have suggested to give the territories depending of the Arequipa Capitancy to the Incan Empire to thank them for their intervention during the war. Although they were forced to surrender, the Incans decided the issue of the war by killing the Rebel leader Bolivar. Ceding Cuzco would surely assure us a period of peace in Colombia and ease the tensions that have accumulated over the years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46448.A;We'll keep it of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46448.B;We'll give it to them as a payment for their help;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM_lib1.T;The end of the rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM_lib1.D;The rebels have spread liberal ideas throughout Colombia and many people in our colonies are inclined toward these. Many of the soldiers fighting in the war have heard of them and it seems the liberal hydra will be hard to stop. We can choose to keep absolutism and force the colonies to bow before our representatives. However reconciling with them by allowing them to elect their government under our supervision will be appreciated over the Atlantic but will create dissent here in Spain. Or more simply we could grant a Constitution to both the Colombians and the Spanish peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46449.A;Absolutism will keep our empire strong ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46449.B;Homerule for the colonies but absolutism at home;;;;;;;;;;;;;

46454.B;It is not the right time;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM10.T; Lusitania reclaimed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM10.D; Rejoice citizens of Gran Columbia! Our armies have expelled the Spanish corps that had occupied the Lusitanian coast. The loyalists in the area have already given a copious donation for the war effort;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CLM11.T; Yucatan recaptured;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM11.D;After fierce fightings in the jungle our armed forces have successfully repelled the Monarchists from the Yucatan peninsula. A threat to the heart of the resistance has been deleted and a generous donation has been made for the war effort !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46461.A;Onward to victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM12.T;Carthago Nova deleta est;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM12.D;The Antioquia region has been retaken by the glorious forces of his Majesty. Once the heart of the vice-royalty of Granada, Cartagena de Indias is now in ruins. Victim of fierce fightings between Loyalists and Independentists, the city was shelled by the Spanish navy in 1819 and never fully recovered. However many of the landowners of the area are trusting the monarchy to rebuild the city and they have made a gracious donation to help vanquish the rebels. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46462.A;Onward to victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM13.T;Cuzco retaken;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM13.D;Our forces are parading in the streets of the old capital of the Inca Empire. The looting of the area has provided a nice benefit for the crown and the control of the Amerigan region shows that the war will soon be over;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46463.A;Onward to victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM14.T;Partial Peace ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM14.D;The victory in Yucatan and Lusitania can't hide the fact that the war is harsh. Maybe we could try to ask a deal with the Spanish to secure the revolution in the Northern territories ? We could cede them the Granadan territories allowing us to lick our wounds and later save them;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46464.A;All of Colombia will be free or none will;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46464.B;Try to make the deal ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM15.T;Peace in Colombia ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM15.D;Rebel representatives have approached us to discuss a peace. They are ready to relinquish all Granadan territories if we accept the independence of their Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46465.A;Take Granada and Andagoya;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46465.B;We won't be satisfied with only Granada. Onwards to Mexico !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM16.T;Treaty of Cartagena ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM16.D;After a long and bloody war, Mexican representatives have agreed on peace with the Spanish crown. Gran Colombia is recognized as an independent nation but all the territories dependent of the old vice-royalty of Granada along with Andagoya will be ceded to Spain. Already, crowds are gathering in Nova Lisboa and San Salvador to blame the Mexican government and the so-proclaimed president Miranda for the defeat. What will happen to the Federation ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46466.A;At least Central America will be free ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM17.T;Administration of Granada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM17.D;The treaty of Cartagena has left us with many possibilities in Ameriga. We could maintain the old order but at the cost of increased rebellions or allow home-rule. In the latter we have to decide how to divide the area. Keeping a strong Granada could be needed against the belligerent Federation in the North but it could also be dangerous, should it rebel ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46467.A;Keep them under our direct administration ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46467.B;Reestablish a Granadan vice-royalty to govern these territories ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46467.C;Divide the old vice-royalty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM18.T;Legitimity questionned;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM18.D;With the signature of the peace of Cartagena, the hold of Mexico over the Federation has loosened. Both Lusitanian and Mesoamericans are asking for a congress to be held in Mexico to decide of the future of the federation. However many generals fear the outcome of this session and partisans of the war hero Santa Anna want him to take command. Such a move would however only increase the various independentists movements...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46468.A;Call a Congress in two months, we stand true to democratic ideas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46468.B;We can't afford division while the king holds Andagoya ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM19.T;The Congress of Mexico : Opening;;;;;;;;;;;;;

46470.A;What awaits the Federation ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM21.T;The Congress of Mexico : United Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM21.D;Despite the apparent ditrust toward the government the Federation will continue to live. With the inclusion of Mesoamerigan and Lusitanian in our government we can prepare the liberation of Granada !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46471.A;Now we have to save Granadans ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM22.T;The Congress of Mexico : End of the Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM22.D;The Lusitanian and Mesoamerigan have voted the end of Gran Colombia. The distrust, the fear accumulated against the Mexican government has shown itself and it is too late to maintain Gran Colombia as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46472.A;It is the end of the Federation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM23.T;The Congress of Mexico : Division of Mexico ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46473.A;How did we fall so low ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM24.T;The Veracruz Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM24.D;Maintaining Order in Gran Colombia has been hard since the accession of Santa Anna to Presidency. Liberals are criticizing "the extraordinary measures" took by Santa Anna and some already think that Spanish domination would be softer than the one imposed by the Mexican miltary. To help fight the secessionist movements in Lusitania and Mesoamerica, Santa Anna has met in Veracruz with Inacio Madeira and José Morazan. The first is a Lusitanian war hero who has led the recapture of Nova Lisboa in the last moments of the war and thus acquired a prestigious figure in Lusitania. The second is the symbol of assimilation of the Native populations, his family indeed originates from Mayan caciques who then became great figures in San Salvador. A leader of the independence war, he is revered by both Mayan and Mesoamerigan populations. Along with these two prominent figures, Santa Anna has designed a plan which divides the country into three spheres of influence until the Federation is ready to fight once more the Spanish. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46474.A;It is not like we have another choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46474.B;Lusitania is a fine place to rule ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM25.T;The Monclova Fort;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM25.D;Tension have erupted in Tejas since the Veracruz Plan. Madeira has always refused to accept Mexican claims on the territories that belonged to the vice-royalty of Lusitania. But Santa Anna recently said a small garrison near Monclova in a move to anger Madeira. He reacted and destroyed the fort, killing the Mexican soldiers. Now it is war against Mexico for the independence of Lusitania !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46475.A;It is time to end Santa Anna's rule ! Lusitania shall be free !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM26.T;Tejas incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM26.D;Mexican forces have been killed in a fort located in Lusitanian territory ! Madeira has refused to condemn the attack and has declared the independence of Lusitania, free from Mexico !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46476.A;Madeira will learn his place !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM27.T;An herald from Salvador;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM27.D;Morazan has refused to take action against Madeira ! Furthermore he wants us to acknowledge the independence of the Mesoamerigans or he'll go to war against Mexico ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46477.A;Morazan too ? He will be crushed as well !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46477.B;Leave him be, Madeira is more dangerous ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM28.T;Failure of Veracruz Plan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CLM28.D;With the ongoing war, no one can say that we represent the Federation...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
46478.A;We will reforge Gran Colombia by iron and blood !;;;;;;;;;;;;;

135602.T;Plantagenia's Offer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135602.D;A letter has arrived from our Viceroy in Athesia. It seems that the Kingdom of Plantagenia has offered to purchase the peninsula from us. They have a great deal of money set aside for the purchase and our current financial and political situation makes us more inclined to accept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The proposal concerns one of our colonies, where several acres of viable farmland could potentially be exploited more efficiently under new and industrialized forms of agriculture. Naturally, this proposal would require the expropriation by the state of said land, to then be sold at a fair market price to the interestes of capital. Mere technicalities, am I right?;;Hmmh, also, wenn uns $CAPITAL$ vielleicht bei unserer kleinen Unternehmung unterstützen könnte, wären wir wirklich sehr erfreut.'\n\nMehrere führende Mitglieder der industriellen Elite des Landes, die glauben, eine neue profitable Geschäftsidee gefunden zu haben, sind mit der Regierung in Kontakt getreten. Ihr Vorschlag betrifft eine unserer Kolonien, in der mehrere Hektar rentablen Ackerlandes durch die Einführung neuer und industrialisierter Bewirtschaftungsmethoden effizienter genutzt werden könnten.

We were not invited to the colonies, and, frankly, I find our presence in them to be rude.'\n\nAn anti-colonial malaise has taken hold in $COUNTRY$, where more and more of our people are beginning to question our colonial ambitions. The colonies are increasingly being seen more as burdens than as boons, and this situation is beginning to hamper our ability to motivate them before the general public.;;Was ich einfach nicht begreifen kann, ist, warum unsere Regierung darauf besteht, zur Beibehaltung imperialistischer Überseeprojekte, die uns außer Schulden nichts einbringen, weiterhin jährlich Tausende, wenn nicht Millionen Pfund auszugeben.

Critics of government policy point to the relatively low wages and poor funds alotted to colonial officials as determining reasons for the scandal, while the prevailing mood in government circles seems to be that a culture of corruption within the private sector is to blame for the poor state of the Colonial Office.;Un scandale de corruption latente au sein du Bureau colonial $COUNTRY_ADJ$ secoue $CAPITAL$ alors qu'un éminent journal publie des rapports détaillant un important réseau de corruptions et de faveurs mis en place pour favoriser certains intérêts privés en termes de commerce et d'exploitation coloniaux. Les critiques proférées à l'égard de la politique gouvernementale pointent du doigt les bas salaires et piètres fonds alloués aux fonctionnaires coloniaux comme les raisons déterminantes du scandale, alors que la tendance prédominante au sein des cercles gouvernementaux semble indiquer que la culture de la corruption du secteur privé est à l'origine de l'état déplorable du Bureau colonial.;Ein sich langsam entfaltender Korruptionsskandal im $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Kolonialamt erschüttert $CAPITAL$. Bedeutende Zeitungen veröffentlichen Berichte über ein ausgedehntes Bestechungs- und Begünstigungsnetzwerk, das darauf ausgelegt ist, hinsichtlich des Kolonialhandels und der Kolonialausbeutung bestimmten Privatinteressen Vorrang zu geben. Kritiker unserer Regierungspolitik weisen auf die relativ geringen Löhne und Budgets von Kolonialoffiziellen als Hauptgründe des Skandals hin, während in Regierungskreisen eher die Meinung vorzuherrschen scheint, dass tiefgreifende Korruption im Privatsektor für den erbärmlichen Zustand des Kolonialamts verantwortlich ist.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC22000;The Trustee System, or 'Trusty System', was a corrections system originated in the U.S. state of Mississippi, but also employed in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana and others, under which prison convicts with a record of good behavior (often equated with obedience) were allowed to police other prison inmates in a strict, pseudo-military hierarchy of power, with some inmates, deemed especially trustworthy, even being allowed to carry firearms. For profit convict labor was a corner stone of the system. The trustee system was first employed on the Parchman Farm prison in Mississippi, and was, as the 19th century turned into the 20th, much lauded as a profitable and modern corrections system. Reports of widespread inmate abuses would end the system in the 1970s, but, in $YEAR$, it was all the rage in certain $COUNTRY_ADJ$ states.;;Das Trustee System, oder auch 'Trusty System', war ein Strafvollzugssystem, das im US-Bundesstaat entwickelt wurde, aber auch in Alabama, Texas, Louisiana und anderen Bundesstaaten Anwendung fand. Dabei wurde Insassen, die sich gut geführt hatten (bzw. gehorsam gewesen waren), erlaubt, andere Gefangene in einer strengen, pseudo-militärischen Hierarchie zu überwachen. Einige Insassen, die als besonders vertrauenswürdig eingestuft wurden, durften dabei sogar Schusswaffen tragen. Hinsichtlich des Profits stellte die Arbeit der Gefangenen die Basis des Systems da. Das Trustee System wurde zum ersten Mal in einem Gefängnis in Mississippi angewandt, das auch als Parchman Farm bekannt ist. Während des ausgehenden neunzehnten und beginnenden zwanzigsten Jahrhundert wurde dieses System sehr als profitables und modernes Strafvollzugsverfahren gepriesen. Berichte von umfassendem Missbrauch von Gefangen bedeuteten Ende der 1970er Jahre das Ende des Systems, aber im Jahr $YEAR$ war es in bestimmten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Staaten wieder in Mode.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC22010;The idea of isolating offenders and breachers of the public peace from society in general is probaby as old as time itself. Many classical systems of justice included banishment from the realm as a last resort type of punishment, reserved for serious crimes and offences, and such punishment was not seldom considered worse than a death penalty. With the growth of the European colonial empires during the 18th and 19th centuries, these ideas recieved a modern incarnation in the form of the penal colony, with renowned (or infamous) examples being the British colony at Botany Bay and the French 'Devil's Island' in French Guiana. Since $COUNTRY$ occupies several territories that could be well suited for such a purpose, perhaps we ourselves should consider establishing such institutions?;;Die Idee, Straftäter von der Gesellschaft zu isolieren ist wahrscheinlich einer der ältesten Ideen überhaupt. Viele klassische Rechtssysteme verfügten den Ausschluss aus dem Reich als äußerstes Strafmaß, das für schwere Verbrechen vorbehalten blieb und oft schlimmer als die Todesstrafe empfunden wurde. Mit dem Aufstieg der europäischen Kolonialreiche während des achtzehnten und neunzehnten Jahrhunderts wurde diese Idee in Form der Strafkolonie wieder aufgenommen. Berühmte bzw. berüchtigte Beispiele sind die britische Strafkolonie in Botany Bay und die französische 'Teufelsinsel' in Französisch-Guayana.

EVTDESC22070;As the 19th century dawned on Europe, the practice of jailing people who defaulted on their debts was still norm. In England, infamous examples of such institutions - Debtor's Prisons - include London's Fleet Prison. In these institutions debtors where not seldom expected to pay for both board and room, and sometimes even special 'Jailor's Fees', to effectively pay their jailors for their upkeep. Often times, these practices only served to further complicate the debtor's financial situation, as it for natural reasons is hard to earn money from inside a prison wall. The system was gradually abandoned in most European countries throughout the 19th century, and London's Fleet Prison was torn down in 1846. A wrongly jailed $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrat is now drawing public attention to these institutions, calling for their abolishment.;;Noch wenige Jahrzehnte vor dem neunzehnten Jahrhundert war es noch gängige Praxis, zahlungsunfähige Menschen zu inhaftieren. Das Londoner Fleet-Gefängnis in England war ein berüchtigtes Beispiel für eine derartige Einrichtung. In diesen Gefängnissen wurde es von den Schuldnern nicht selten verlangt, für Kost und Logis selbst aufzukommen. Manchmal mussten sie sogar zusätzliche 'Jailor's Fees' entrichten, um den Unterhalt der Gefängnisse, in den sie einsaßen, zu sichern. Oftmals wurde die finanzielle Situation eines inhaftierten Schuldners dadurch nur noch verschlimmert, da das Geldverdienen hinter Gefängnismauern selbstverständlich sehr mühsam war. Im Verlauf des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts wurde das System in den meisten europäischen Ländern allmählich abgeschafft. Das Londoner Fleet-Gefängnis wurde im Jahr 1846 abrissen.

EVTNAME22080;Capital Punishment;Peine capitale;Todesstrafe;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC22080;A debate in the $CAPITAL$ Reform Club tonight, regarding the death penalty, has seen new arguments advanced from the opponents of the punishment. Focusing in on the irrevocability of the punishment, in tandem with the ever present risk of wrongful sentencing, liberals have joined together to form a Citizen's committe to abolish the sentence. The debate has been caused by the much publicized recent execution of an elderly gentleman convicted of murdering his wife, despite the fact that the man was clearly in the advanced stages of age related dementia. The newly founded committee calls upon members of parliament to speak out against what they consider to be the most horrendous of injustices, and have sought an audience with the cabinet to explain their position.;;Eine Debatte im $CAPITAL$-Reformverein über die Todesstrafe hat heute Nacht neue Argumente gegen die Todesstrafe geliefert. Wichtigste Punkte dabei waren die Unwiderruflichkeit des Todesurteils und das allgegenwärtige Risiko einer ungerechten Verurteilung. Liberale machen jetzt mit einem Bürgerkomitee zur Abschaffung der Todesstrafe gemeinsame Sache. Die Debatte wurde durch die stark publizierte, vor kurzem vollzogene Hinrichtung eines betagten Ehrenmannes für den Mord an seiner Frau ausgelöst, obwohl der Mann ganz eindeutig bereits stark dement war. Das neugegründete Komitee ruft Parlamentsmitglieder auf, sich gegen diese in ihren Augen entsetzliche Ungerechtigkeit auszusprechen, und haben beim Parlament um eine Audienz gebeten, um ihren Standpunkt darzulegen.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC20110;A recent demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought attention to the plight of natives in $STATENAME$, namely to their oppression by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and their demands for independence.

EVTDESC20111;A recent riot in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought a great deal of attention to $STATENAME$-- the kind that would normally prompt the great powers to consider intervention.

CRO1.T;Illyrian Brothers ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO1.D;The ongoing Ottoman Civil war present us with an interesting choice right now. We have asserted our independence from the Empire recently and we have become a beacon of hope for the Slav populations living under the Muslim yoke. A proposition was made recently to enter a war against the Empire to free Serbia before Hungary or another vulture takes the territory for itself. Or we could just wait for the Empire to be in an even worse situation and take the territory for ourselves ….;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CRO3.T;The end of the Personal Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO3.D;Serbia has been ruled by our king since its liberation near the end of the Ottoman Civil War but has enjoyed a relative autonomy in its internal affairs.

CRO7.T;Intervention in Montenegro ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO7.D;Before the Civil War, Montenegro was divided in various principalites. The Metropolitan finally achieved unification around him and went on expelling the powerful Simic family which ruled Kotor. The heir to the war hero Peter Simic, Joseph Simic is an idealistic panslavist and he has many times confessed that his father wanted Montenegro to join the Illyian kingdom. We could let him act and enter Montenegro with followers to see if we could not force the Metropolitan to bow before us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400107.A;Send him across the border;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400107.B;Imprison him;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO8.T;The Simic rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO8.D;The Illyrian have allowed the claimant to the dukedom of Montenegro, Jospeh Simic to sneak into Kotor where he actually tries to convince people to join our heretic neighbour. Should we take action against him, it is likely the Croat will advance into our country so we must try to find someone to back our independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400108.A;The Metropolitan will step down and accept the claim of Simic ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400108.B;Contact Venice we need help to defend ourselves ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

CRO9.T;Simic suceeds !;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1400109.A;That was a good idea to send him ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO10.T;Montenegrin embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO10.D;The Illyrians threaten the rule of the Metropolitan who has asked us to protect him. How should we react ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

1400110.B;It is not in our interest;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO11.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ supports Montenegro !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO11.D;The Metropolitan has been swift to act against Simic. He expelled him and has found an ally to protect him in case we decide to invade his country ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400111.A;We will let them alone ... for now;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400111.B;We will take Montenegro by force then. Nothing stops the Yugoslavs !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO12.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ threw away the Montenegro embassy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO12.D;The Metropolitan tried to find someone to protect him after the expulsion of Simic but $FROMCOUNTRY$ refused to protect him. We can now easily override their defences and annex Montenegro into our glorious kingdom !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400112.A;We will take Montenegro by force then. Nothing stops the Yugoslavs !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO13.T;The status of Belgrade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO13.D;During the Ottoman Civil War, Hungary attacked the Empire and took Belgrade while we were liberating Serbia. It has been a long time since their campaign of "protection" of the Serbs and we have a duty to ask them to give Belgrade to the crown of Stefan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400113.A;Send an ultimatum to Budapest;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO14.T;Illyrian Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO14.D;The Illyian King has issued a declaration in which he demands us to relinquish the Serbian lands we captured during the Civil War. The Serbs have been restless around their old capital and holding unto them will harm relations with our allies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400114.A;We'll retreat from Serbia ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
1400114.B;Like we would give up Belgrade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
CRO15.T;Hungarian refusal;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME135100;Dahomey Refuses to Pay Tribute;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135100;To ensure the peace between our nations, Dahomey has been paying us tribute ever since the 18th century. It has become tradition at this point, but Dahomey has just rejected it. The tribute was the only thing keeping us from attacking them, now we let's show them why they paid it in the first place!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135100.A;We cannot accept this;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME135101;We Have Won The War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135101;We have managed to keep our independence and are no longer obligated to pay tribute to the Oyo Empire. This is a great day for our nation. Let the flag of the elephant fly in the winds!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME135102;We Have Lost The War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135102;It is a dark day for our nation, we tried to break free and we failed. This was not the day of the flag of the elephant...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135102.A;We have failed our people;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME135103;The Dahomey Amazons;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135103;The Dahomey Amazons were originally established as a group of female elephant hunters in the 17th century by King Houegbadja, in the early 18th century his son, King Agaja, made them into the bodyguards of the king, armed with muskets. According to tradition, Agaja also developed them into a militia that helped win a war against the Kingdom of Savi. What their job in the army always has been is just to hold banners to make the army seem bigger than it actually is, however some suggest that we might make even better use of them if they were turned into an actual female corp that'd fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135103.A;Summon the daughters of every family for military training!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135103.B;Keep them ceremonial and let them help the economy when we're at peace;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME135104;Ideas of Absolutism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135104;The idea of an absolute monarch being able to rule better than a feudal one is spreading throughout the kingdom, although not widespread it continues to be more and more popular. They are taking the European states and some of our neighbors as proof of absolutism being better, seeing as many of them seem to be more successful. Maybe we can capitalize on this and abolish the stubborn tribes of our Kingdom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135104.A;We must implement these ideas immediately;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135104.B;We can't break this age old tradition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME135105;Slave Market Failing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135105;The market for slavery is doing worse and worse everyday, people don't want to buy new ones and instead try to sell their old ones. Some of the reasons for this are that slaves have demanded more and more rights under the years and you now have the responsability of taking care of your slaves well being aswell as many slave revolts in the Kingdom resulting in several owners killed. The advisers are trying to come up with ideas with how we can fix this problem, but so far the only options we seem to have are either loosening the restrictions on owning a slave and encouraging slavery amongst the farms or just completely abolish slavery as many consider it unethical aswell as it not being very benefitial for the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135105.A;I suppose it's a bit outdated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135105.B;Loosening the restrictions should help;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME135106;The Culture of Dahomey;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135106;The culture in Dahomey has always been very distinct from elsewhere in Africa. Much of the arts are subsidized by the royal family and the artists aren't of any specific class, but instead can be created by anyone from a lord to a peasant. One of the many things that make our country so great is the Royal Palaces of Abomey which are several palaces spread over a large complex, every palace contains stone carvings depicting the many accomplishments of the king and every king had his own palace. There are two unique aspects of art in Dahomey, firstly it's the assembling of different components, using many different materials, and secondly it's the borrowing of culture from neighboring people. Some say our focus should lie in developing our own culture, but many are also intrigued by the cultures of the outside world. We could either focus on and subsidize our own local culture and develop it or we could embrace some of the western ideas in hopes of becoming more like them or we could embrace some of our islamic neighbors' traditions and learn from them instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135106.A;Embrace our own great and beautiful culture;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135106.B;Embrace some of the western beliefs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135106.C;Integrate some of the islamic culture into our society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME135107;A Backward Country;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135107;While there's no doubt that our country is great and beautiful it is no lie that we are behind many other countries in the region, especially the European nations on the coast. We must combat this by developing our own country into something it couldn't even imagine a few generations ago. One of the biggest reasons the Europeans, and some of our neighbors, are so ahead is their academia, their's are much larger than ours. To be able to transform into a developed country we must increase it, however we're not completely sure of what the best way of doing do would be. Some say educating the people is the best way, just look at the literacy rate in Europe, while some say that we should just further educate what we have and refine it into an elite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135107.A;We must educate our people, it is a human right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135107.B;We should focus on further educating our already intelligent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME135108;Akans Raiding;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135108;Recently we've recieved several reports of of raidings from the Ewe chiefs, and all of them are claiming that the raiders are Akans. They are telling us that the raiders are coming on a weekly basis, stealing food and loot. Confronting some of the leaders of the Akan people they told us that they were former soldiers who pillaged for food and then claimed that they couldn't do anything about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
135108.A;This is intolerable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME135109;Helping A Home or A Helping Hand?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC135109;Our nation has developed into something so magnificent, all of Africa adores it. Our great handling of diplomacy, economy and military has led us to this beautiful moment. The only question left is, where do we go now?

Known since ancient times, and first described as a contagious disease by Avicenna in 1020, typical symptoms of the disease include chronic cough, fever, and the expulsion of blood-tinged phlegm. In the 19th century, the disease was sometimes romanticized, as several famous authors and poets of the era were known sufferers.;;Einer der größten Geißeln der Menschheit im neunzehnten Jahrhundert war die Tuberkulose, eine ansteckende Krankheit, die meistens die Lungen befällt.

Dies ist aber für die Bevölkerung Ihres Staats, wo im $YEAR$ eine Pockenepidemie ausgebrochen ist, wohl nur ein geringer Trost.;;;;;;;;;;;

ENL5.T;A Savoyard opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENL5.D;For a long time we have coveted the Alpine passes held by the Duke of Savoy. The Dual-Monarchy faces open rebellion and is thus less inclined to protect the Duke.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
101105.A;We will claim Savoy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
101105.B;It is too risky;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENL6.T;Ultimatum from Antwerp;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENL6.D;Burgundy asks us to relinquish our Alpine lands to integrate them into 'the Duchy of Geneva'. With the Dual-Monarchy facing harsh unrest we should not count too much on their protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
101106.A;We will not risk a war against Burgundy ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
101106.B;We will not surrender our ancestral lands !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENL7.T;Savoyard Answer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
ENL7.D;The duke of Savoy has refused, meaning that only war will resolve the problem of the Alpes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
101107.A;We will take it then !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA1.T;The Anglois Dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA1.D;Ever since the Treaty of Rome in 1498, the Dual Monarchy has had to walk a fine line in not favouring one of its ethnic groups over the others. Recent censi have shown that the English and French represent around one-fifth of the population. What is more threatening to either group is not the other but rather a growing group calling themselves Anglois. These groups have created the dilemma for the monarchy in who to favor. There are those in power that believe that it is best to pick a side while others believe that the Anglois ideology of blending the best customs of English and French is the way of the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650201.A;Lean toward the French;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650201.B;Lean toward the English;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650201.C;We are kings of France AND England ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA2.T;The Death of King Henri X;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA2.D;Tragedy has struck the Dual Monarchy as His Majesty King Henri X has passed with no heir. Due to traditional laws within the Dual Monarchy, the Estates-General has been called to select their choice for the next ruler of the Kingdom. The Estates have narrowed the selection between Elisabeth, Duchess of Anjou, Edouard, the Duke of York, and Henri, the Duke of Gascony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650202.A;Who will succeed on the throne ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA3.T;Coronation of Elisabeth I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA3.D;Despite some opposition votes the Estates-General has declared that Elisabeth will be the next Queen of the Dual Monarchy. Being the daughter of the King's brother gave her the strongest claim to the throne but her pro-Anglois ties has led to some opposition from those in France and England. Both Edouard and Henri have respected the Estates decision and pledged their support to Elisabeth in the future of the Dual Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650203.A;Long live Elisabeth I !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA4.T;Coronation of Edouard X;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA4.D;It took the Estates-General some rounds of voting but they have settled on Edouard, the Duke of York, as the next King of the Dual Monarchy. England has received the news with great joy while France is worried of potential retribution by the new king for past injustices. Elisabeth and Henri have renounced the throne but Henri vows that he will participate in the Parliament of Lords in preventing bias legislation by the King from being passed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650204.A;Long live Edward X !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA5.T;Coronation of Henri XI;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA5.D;To the shock of many Henri, the Duke of Gascony, has been elected the next King of the Dual Monarchy. His election as King has been recieved with joy in the southern regions of the country but outrage has broken out in England. Elisabeth and Edouard has both renounced the throne but Edouard expressed his great displeasure with the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650205.A;Long live Henry XI !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA6.T;The English Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA6.D;England is now free but what form of government shall it take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650206.A;We will crown a noble king of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650206.B;We need no King !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA7.T;Protection;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA7.D;The Anglois will surely not let us go so easily and we are at a disadvantage. We need to contact a Great Power to counter the threat from Paris : Scandinavia has a good navy and shares a border in Scotland; Burgundy will surely dominate on the Continent, Aragon can easily pierce through Occitania.;;;;;;;;;;;;
650207.A;We'll try to ally Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650207.B;We'll try to ally Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650207.C;We'll try to ally Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA8.T;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA8.D;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have revolted against the Dual-Monarchy and are asking to protect them from the Anglois. Such a move will lead to war against Paris but it is a golden opportunity to weaken the Plantagenets!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650208.A;It is not in our interest ... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650208.B;Everything to weaken the Plantagenets !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA9.T;A new Hastings;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA9.D;The English will face our might !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650209.A;The English will be taught the true power of the Dual-Monarchy !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA10.T;The French Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA10.D;After the questions of the last years, the monarchy has affirmed its French character. Rooted in Paris, the monarchy has gained the support of the French population and of its leaders. This French orientation has allowed them to suppress any rebellion in the South but in the same time has alienated them a great part of the English population...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650210.A;Dieu sauve le roi !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA11.T;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA11.D;The radicalization of the English society has increased over the past few months. The French turnout of Henri X has alienated him many Englishmen, who were eager to support the monarchy have turned to the liberal hydra. Yesterday the repression of a student manifestation in Cambridge has launched a spiral of violence all over England. It has culminated in the creation of the English Republic which is decided to push “the French out of England”. Apart from some loyalists bastion in Wales and Londres, the revolutionaries are already in control of most the island. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650211.A;We will crush these revolutionaries!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA12.T;St-Louis Speech;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA12.D;The king of the Dual-Monarchy has organised a great ceremony throughout the cities of France to honour his ancestor Louis XI king of France later sanctified as “Saint Louis”. He has put the accent on the treaty of Paris who settled peace between the Plantagenets and the Capetians. In a speech pronounced in the capital by Henri X affirming the French character of the monarchy who always has never forgotten its French roots. While praised on the continent, the speech has been criticized by many in England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650212.A;Je vous ai compris !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA13.T;The great travel of Henri;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA13.D;To further enhance his presence, Henri X decided to travel amongst France. He first visited Normandie where he praised his ancestor Guillaume who embarked to conquer England. He then turned to Brittany, a land attached to the Plantegenian monarchs. His travel led him then to La Rochelle. There he met several of the “Young French” leaders who spontaneously rallied to him and praised his signs in favour of France. He then travelled south passing through Gascony, Toulouse. He then made a stop in Vichy to remember the last great battle against the Valois before returning to the capital. Many people are acclaiming the king for this action that has strengthened the hold of the monarchy in France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650213.A;Les Plantagenets sont veritablement les rois des Français !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA14.T;The Sons of Harold;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA14.D;Lately a wave of contests have risen in England towards the French turn-around of Henri X. The English people have been indeed absent from the speeches of Henri and many are looking to alternatives. A certain John Tolsmith, professor in Cambridge, lately published a monumental history of England before the Norman Conquest. His book has become incredibly popular amongst the English students who have created an association to valorise their “English inheritance” called the “sons of Harold”, in reference to Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king. While this may only be a cultural association, many of its members are prone to radical ideas and it is said that the slogan of “Freiheit, Gleicheit, Brüderlichkeit” are murmured in these circles … ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650214.A;We shall watch these Englishmen ....;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA15.T;Spread of the Sons of Harold;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA15.D;The sons of Harold have implemented themselves in this province and are already spreading their ideas ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650215.A;Worrisome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA16.T;"L'anglais est-il est une langue ?";;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA16.D;A dispute has emerged in the Sorbonne between two scholars to determine if English can be considered as a true language worthy of being spoken in the high spheres such as the government. While it can be seen as just a philological debate, we could influence the result in one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650216.A;Some noises made by peasants aren't a language !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650216.B;English is as good as French;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650216.C;Do not take part in philological debates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA17.T;A new minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA17.D;Sadly our prime minister has died in office. It falls upon the monarch to choose a new prime minister. Three candidates have the favour of the Parliament : the duke of Richelieu, known for his inclination for the Young French, the duke of Rohan, the Breton moderate and lastly the duke of Devonshire, well-known in the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650217.A;Richelieu shall be Prime Minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650217.B;Rohan shall be Prime Minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650217.C;Devonshire shall be Prime Minister;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA18.T;The Shakespeare festival;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA18.D;The English have organised a festival in Stratford upon Avon to honour a play-writer called William Shakespeare. Rediscovered by the sons of Harold, this unknown author has written many tragicomedies in English, which criticize heavily the Parisian Monarchy while praising English historical figures like his life of Alfred the Great in 4 plays. This festival could become a centre of protestation especially if they represent Henry VI;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650218.A;Let them have their festival, what could possibly happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650218.B;Watch it and place it under heavy guard;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650218.C;Forbid it !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA19.T;The death of the Prince of Wales;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA19.D;While visiting England, the Prince of Wales and his entourage were attacked by radicals in the city of Liverpool. It resulted in the death of Henry, the heir of the Dual-Monarchy, his pregnant wife and his son. The attack made with an artisanal weaponry, that many call "the Infernal Machine", was imagined by students affiliated to the Sons of Harold. While Tolsmith has denied any implication of his organisation and vigorously condemned the attack, the king is persuaded of his implication and is determined in his grief to shut the the organisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650219.A;Shut this terrorist organisation down !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650219.B;They are not responsible;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA21.T;The English Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA21.D;Despite the troubles of the past years the monarchy has asserted its English roots. With London and Paris weighing the same in political matters the monarchy has gained the support of the English population!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650221.A;God save our King !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA22.T;The Midi Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA22.D;The English backlash of Henry X has alienated the Southern French lands. The local Occitans have always been more rebellious because of their protestant roots and also because of their support for the Valois kings. The Revolt supported by the Sons of St-Louis has gained the control of most Occitania!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650222.A;What is happening ?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA23.T;Choosing the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA23.D;The Occitan state must now choose what form of government it shall be : will they welcome the Valois pretender or proclaim a free Republic ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650223.A;We welcome the true kings of France !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650223.B;We don't need petty kings !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA24.T;The March on Toulouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA24.D;The rebellious Occitan have acknowledged the Valois as the true Kings of France and pledged their loyalty to the reconquest of the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650224.A;The usurpers will be driven out !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA25.T;The new Hundred Years War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA25.D;Provence has taken control of our rebellious provinces and has pledged to not stop until Paris! We can't let them do this and must put an end to the War for the French Throne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650225.A;It is the last time the Valois deny our rights !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA26.T;The Counter-revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA26.D;Occitania has affirmed as an independent Republic! We can't let them do such a thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650226.A;It is the last time the Occitan rebel !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA27.T;Creation of the Sons of St-Louis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA27.D;A french nationalist organisation has been created yesterday in La Rochelle by a certain Francois Guizot, a university historian. The aim of this association is to strengthen the conscience of the French and Provencal people and make them aware of their distinctness from the British. The name has been taken from Louis XI, a King who was later canonized and who he is seen as a fatherly figure of French history. It is particularly popular amongst the French students and many fear they might be spreading revolutionary ideals...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650227.A;We shall watch these 'patriots' ....;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA28.T;Spread of the Sons of St-Louis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA28.D;The sons of St-Louis have implemented themselves in this province and are already spreading their ideas ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650228.A;Worrisome;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA29.T;The Great Royal Travel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA29.D;To further enhance his presence, Henri X decided to travel amongst England. He first landed near Hastings where he praised his ancestor Guillaume who there managed to win the English crown. He then went to Londres where he visited the locals of the East Indian Company on the boards of the Tamise. His travel led him then to Cambridge and Ofxord. There he met several of the “Young English” leaders who spontaneously rallied to him and praised his signs in favour of England. He then travelled west and north passing through Wales and Livreport. He then made a stop in York to praise Richard Plantagenet, duke of York, one of the heroes of the early Dual-Monarchy. Many people are acclaiming the king for this action that has strengthened the hold of the monarchy in England.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650229.A;The Plantegenets are truly the Kings of England !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA30.T;Romanticism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA30.D;A new school has appeared in arts. The Romanticists defy the laws established by the classical school of Paris and coming back to the roots of Baroque. It is especially successful in England. Tolsmith and Lord Byron are publishing poems taking their roots in the old Saxon mythology, Scnery is writing plays who are inspired by Shakespeare... This school has however little sucess amongst the literary critics of the capital who accuse them of recklessly crossing laws that were fixed by wise Elders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650230.A;Support the movement!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650230.B;Classic Poetry is best!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA40.T;The Anglois dilemma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA40.D;Reconciling both French and English will not be an easy task, Henri X knows it very well. The two groups may not like each other but they hate Paris even more, so an alliance of both needs to be prevented. However one must not charge too much against one group unless one wants a local revolution to happen ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650240.A;We will endure as we always have;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA41.T;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA41.D;Missing localisation. Please report to Divergences' developer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA42.T;Pacification of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA42.D;Despite the peril we managed to win against the revolutionaries, a fact that has strengthened our hold on all our territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650242.A;Pesky little English ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA43.T;Independence of England;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA43.D;The English nationalists have secured their independence. We can't succeed in our current policy with them being independent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650243.A;It is but a flesh wound !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA44.T;Pacification of the Midi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA44.D;The Southern parts of our kingdom have been secured ! Despite the rebellion we can continue our policy of accepting both French and English !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650244.A;Pesky little Occitans ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA45.T;Independent Occitania;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA45.D;The South has escaped from our power. With our mainland territories threatened we can't surely make our rule accepted in both England and France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650245.A;It is but a flesh wound !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA46.T;The Midi Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA46.D;Missing localisation. Please report to Divergences' developer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650246.A;The Provencaux will regret this !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA47.T;The Franco-English Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA47.D;Revolters have swarmed the streets of the great cities of the Dual-Monarchy in a scale not seen since the First German Revolution ! The nationalist rebels are decided to end the monarchy in blood if necessary and with it the very idea of the Anglois dream.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650247.A;All is crumbling !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA48.T;The Anglo-French monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA48.D;The Plantagenet throne has endured ! Despite the threat of radicals, nationalists and foreign power, all its people stands ready to serve their country ! The coming decades will surely be Anglois for who can stand against the combined force of the Dual-Monarchy of France and England ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650248.A;Eventually we prevail !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA50.T;Choosing a Patron;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA50.D;The King has to choose an historical figure to honor in the coming months. Several proposals have emerged : Alfred the Great, the old Saxon king is admired by many across the Channel, Louis XI the Holy is seen as a benevolent figure here on the continent, Edouard IV was the first Plantagenet born in Paris and thus is seen as both a rallying figure for the Anglois but also a usurper for the French and a traitor for the English. No matter who the King chooses to honour it will not please everyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650250.A;St-Louis is worthy of our recognition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650250.B;Alfred the Great is worthy of our recognition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650250.C;Edouard IV is worthy of our recognition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA51.T;Liberal agitations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA51.D;Liberals and Nationalists from both sides of the Channel have formed societies aimed at spreading their ideas. If we allow them, the Sons of Harold and Saint Louis will surely provoke problems in our territories but banishing them will provoke an even bigger reaction ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650251.A;These organisations must be watched closely;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650251.B;Ban both of them !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA52.T;'Histoire de la France depuis ses origines';;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA52.D;The historian Pierre Guizot has published a new book upon the history of France. The book has received a warm response from French scholars for its exhaustivity. But its portrayal of English and early Plantagenets is quite troublesome and his idea of "a distinct spirit existing since the Gauls' War" only amuses the French nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650252.A;He makes some interesting points ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650252.B;And he calls his book historic ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA53.T;Saxon poetry;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA53.D;An anthology of English poetry has been published in Cambridge by the Sons of Harold. Regrouping old and new poets alike, this book has become widely applaused in England but many scholars from Paris consider it a complete waste of time ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650253.A;A truly wonderful piece of art !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650253.B;As I said before, English is not fit for poetry ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA54.T;Travel of the Dauphin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA54.D;Henry X is becoming unfit to travel outside of Paris. He now has to delegate this duty to his son Henry, Dauphin of France and Prince of Wales;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650254.A;Henri will travel through France !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650254.B;It has been a long time since a Royal went in North of England ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650254.C;The Anglois heartlands are more safe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA55.T;A night in theatre ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA55.D;Paris is bursting with cultural creation. Theatres attract the crowds with 3 great pieces having a huge success. First the adaptation of Alfred the Great, the main work of the English author Shakespeare which combines epic and comic, in a way that pleases the Romanticists. Another troup is playing 'Le Malade Imaginaire' of Moliere, a French comic author that travelled the roads of Southern France. Eventually another adaptation of 'Joan the Mad', the tragedy of Racine is still very loved by the court. If one of the Royals would attend one of these spectacles it would surely be seen as a symbol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650255.A;I heard that Shakespeare author was quite entertaining ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650255.B;A Moliere comedy will be best !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650255.C;'Joan the Mad' from Racine will make us remember our glorious history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA56.T;Les Immortels;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA56.D;The Rotal Academy was founded in the XVIIth century to host the greatest literary minds of the whole kingdom and it has since evolved to also codify the official language from the monarchy. One of the Immortals' siege has been liberated and we have to nominate someone. Tolsmith despite being a Saxon is recognized as one of the greatest philologists from the kingdom. In Occitania the poet Jasmin has achieved in seducing the minds of the court. But the grammarian Morel could be nominated to show our will of uniformisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650256.A;I guess Tolsmith could give us another perspective ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650256.B;The Occitan poet Jasmin will remind us from the sunny Midi !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650256.C;Nominate the proud Anglois grammarian Morel;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA57.T;Celebration of the German Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA57.D;Radicals in the Kingdom are preparing for the 55th anniversary of the First German Revolution. Some advisors have talked about allowing them to do so to better control them but if we do so then it will cost us our relations with the Bohemian court... Forbidding them to commemorate and organizing great ceremonies remembering the prowess of our armies during the ensuing wars would certainly be a good symbol of unity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650257.A;If it can please these liberals ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650257.B;We won't associate with these monsters !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA58.T;The Rebellions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA58.D;The ongoing 'Springtime of Nations' threaten our efforts of integration !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650258.A;The Revolution will not anihilate our efforts !;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA60.D;For 20 years the monarchy has encouraged the unity of the peoples on each side of the Channel. It seems that slowly the idea is winning the hearts of the crowds;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA62.T;Conquest of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA62.D;The little Provencal state is no more. Our armies have taken control of what was the biggest thorn on our borders. With the Valois gone, the Anglois state prevails !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650262.A;The Hundred Years war is over !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA63.T;Conquest of Bourgogne;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA63.D;The duchy of Bourgogne is now completely in our control, a fact that has weakened the French movement !;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA64.D;Calais has been retaken by our brave forces ! We now control the closest coast from Britain and proposals of building a link between the continent be it by bridge or tunnel flourish and show our unity !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650264.A;One day maybe both of our lands will be linked !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA65.T;Northern Border secured;;;;;;;;;;;;;

DUA68.T;Scottish problems;;;;;;;;;;;;;
DUA68.D;Our Northern Border allows the worse English elements to find support, weapons or shelter in Scotland. Unless we take control of Scotland, directly or indirectly, the situation could worsen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
650268.A;Scotland should be in our sphere to avoid further problems!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC22510;A major crash on the $CAPITAL$ stock market has devolved into something much worse entirely, following massive bank runs triggered by plummeting saver's confidence in the banking sector. As people scramble to secure their life savings, more and more banks and credit institutions fail, triggering domino effects affecting the entire $COUNTRY_ADJ$ financial sector. The ripples from the crash soon spread to other sectors of private industry, as loans are defaulted and savings vanish seemingly into thin air. Widespread unemployment, caused by entire sectors of industry failing almost overnight, soon follow. With the intertwining of the economies of the western world, the crisis quickly spreads to other countries, and the effects of the crash now reverberate around the world, in what will be known to posterity as: The $YEAR$ Great Depression.;Un important krach de la bourse de $CAPITAL$ a dégénéré à la suite d'un affolement des banques déclenché par une perte de confiance des épargnants dans le secteur bancaire. Alors que chacun s'efforce de préserver ses économies, de plus en plus de banques et d'organismes financiers font faillite entraînant un effet de domino qui affecte tout le secteur financier de $COUNTRY_ADJ$. Les effets de ce krach n'ont pas tardé à se propager à tous les secteurs de l'industrie privée, les prêts étant suspendus et les économies se volatilisant. Une vague de chômage, causée par la faillite de secteurs entiers de l'industrie du jour au lendemain, n'a pas tardé à suivre. Compte tenu de l'imbrication des économies du monde occidental, la crise a rapidement gagné les autres pays et les effets du krach se font désormais sentir partout dans le monde au cours de cette période qui entrera dans l'histoire sous le nom de la Grande Dépression de $YEAR$.;Ein großer Crash an der Börse von $CAPITAL$ hat sich zu etwas viel Schlimmerem entwickelt: Das Vertrauen der Sparer in das Bankensystem ist erschüttert, es kommt zu massenhaften Abhebungen. Während die Bevölkerung versucht, ihre Ersparnisse zu retten, brechen immer mehr Banken und Kreditinstitute zusammen. Dies erzeugt Dominoeffekte, die den gesamten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Finanzsektor betreffen. Die Auswirkungen des Börsencrashs weiten sich schon bald auf andere Sektoren der Privatwirtschaft aus, da Darlehen nicht mehr zurückgezahlt werden können und Ersparnisse sich förmlich in Luft auflösen. Fast über Nacht folgt weit verbreitete Arbeitslosigkeit, verursacht durch den Zusammenbruch ganzer Industriezweige. Aufgrund der Verflechtung der Wirtschaften der westlichen Welt breitet sich die Krise schnell auf andere Länder aus, und die Effekte des Börsencrashs sind nun auf der ganzen Welt zu spüren.

EUR10.T;Birth of the Irish Brotherhood;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EUR10.D;Our focus on France has not only alienated the English but also the Irish. The Gaels while subdued and integrated since the XVIth century have called for autonomy, and some outright independence since the German Wars. Our inability to crush the English rebels has fueled the Irish nationalists agenda. Prominent leaders have apparently met in Dublin to create a secret society called the Irish Brotherhood whose aim is to secure the independence of the Emerald island. We should watch them carefully since they have already try to contact our rivals in Europe to secure their help and weapons ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
48210.A;A worrying development...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EUR11.T;Birth of the Irish Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EUR11.D;Our focus on France has not only alienated the English but also the Irish. The Gaels while subdued and integrated since the XVIth century have called for autonomy, and some outright independence since the German Wars. A new political organisation has been created in Dublin, the Irish Confederation whose goal is to obtain Home-Rule from Paris, a position which has gained traction from the general population for the past few-years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EUR12.T;The Dominion of Ireland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EUR12.D;The Successes of the Irish Confederation has led to a near monopoly of the party over all Irish elections for the past few years.

EUR1.D;With the success of the English Revolution in the south the ideas of independence have spread in Scotland. The most important of the nationalist group, called 'Young Scotland' is led by the son of the famous Scottish writer Walter Scott. Walter Scott Jr has used the legacy of his father to improve his standing amongst the crowds and he is clearly an important agitator. We could ban him and his closest followers or let him act, with the risk of open Scottish rebellion ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

TUS_setupT;The political situation in Etruria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
TUS_setupD;Etruria is the last remaining republic born during the German Revolution. The revolutionaries expelled the Valois-Medici and created sister republics all throughout the peninsula but were forced to negotiate peace and leave the Reaction take over the new Republics. Italy is now as divided as before the Revolution and Etruria is no longer perceived as the hegemon of Italy. Internally, the Priors, whose main base in Florence are the Uffizi and the Piaza Dei Priori, hence their name, rule now again the republic but they are challenged on their left by the Carmagnolesi, the hardcore revolutionaries. On their right the Peasants do not want the Revolution to go further and the Compromisers want Peace in Italy. Some Provenzale supporters still dream of the return of the Valois-Medici but forces of Reaction are weak. If Etruria can surpass petty political rivalries then maybe they'll be able to unify Italy and threaten the old European Order!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Many leaders of the sister republics have fled to Etruria and the carbonari circles number great officials of the reactionary states. With liberalism ideas spreading once again we could activate the Carbonari cells all over Italy to spread the Revolution but then we need to be sure of holding back the forces of reaction...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There are also those who believe that this comet is most probably a gaint ball of ice floating through the sky and the long tail is created due to the energy of the sun. The arguements amoungst the three equally viable theories is stimulating the pursuit of knowledge in our country.;Une comète a été aperçue dans le ciel, ce qui selon certains augure de temps difficiles. D'autres croient qu'il s'agit en fait de fées qui flottent dans le ciel. Puis, il y a ceux qui pensent que cette comète est, vraisemblablement, une boule de glace géante qui traverse le ciel et dont la longue queue résulte de l'énergie solaire. Les discussions liées à ces trois théories viables stimulent la soif de connaissance de notre pays.;Am Nachthimmel wurde ein Komet gesichtet, und manche sehen darin ein Omen für die Zukunft. Andere dagegen glauben, dass Kometen Feen sind, die am Himmel schweben, aber es gibt auch solche, die einen Komet für nichts als einen riesigen Eisball halten, der durch den Himmel zieht, und dessen langer Schweif von der Sonnenenergie erzeugt wird. Die Argumente dieser drei Denkansätze stimulieren in unserem Land das Streben nach Wissen.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME232000000;The Source of the Nile Discovered?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC232000000;I saw, about four miles to the left, a sheet of water, which ultimately proved to be a creek and the southernmost part of what the Arabs call the Ukerewe Sea. Convinced that I finally found the source of the Nile, I went down a grassy and jungly depression into a deep, dirty, viscid nullah, which communicated with the southern end of the creek, which we named Jordan. As we followed the creek, that increased in breadth as it extended northwards, we saw many little islands in Ukerewe, well wooded, standing boldly out of the water. The journey continued through another tortuous day until we reached the village of Isamiro, where the view was clearer and better. In the distant horizon a calm sea line started to appear between north and west. Even in a well known country the view would have attracted attention for its placid beauty, he thought to himself. He felt he had solved the great old riddle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME98301;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME98302;Anger Against the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems-- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing.

EVTNAME98304;Government Supporters Rally;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$.

EVTNAME98305;Orderly Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly.

EVTDESC140201;A group of young officers in the state of $STATENAME$ have started a barfight over a prostitute in a local tavern and proceeded to kill three lower class workers. A sham trial in a military court has found all the officers innocent and the lower classes are infuriated. If we put them up for re-trial in a civil court the lower classes will be appeased but the image of the military will be hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC140301;The deplorable conditions of a barracks in $STATENAME$ has become the subject of a widely read local newspaper. Maggot infested and rotten food along with faulty arms and ammunition has led to numerous injuries and outbreaks of disease. The barracks is supplied by a highly connected group of aristocrats and capitalists who are pressuring the government to ignore the matter, doing so will greatly upset the local soldiers. If we launch an official investigation the public will surely demand greater spending and oversight for military supply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC140501;A highly respected university professor has written an increasingly influential theory supporting a laissez-faire economic policy. His theory has gained many supporters from the artisans of the state who feel threatened by government ties to factory owners. Through our contacts we have learned that this man is a secret homosexual. We could use this against him publically but doing so will anger the artisans and atheists of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC140601;Many of the factory workers in $STATENAME$ live a tragic life. Miserable and dejected," these poor souls are unable to fulfill even the most basic life needs. Among their flimsy shanties and squalid alleys a champion has risen among them. He preaches a new system to the hopeless masses in which every willing man and woman has a job and is provided for. A system in which the rich do not prey upon the weak. Factory workers across the state are heeding his words and the capitalists are fearful of the consequences. We could arrange an ""accident"" during his shift but that will cause great unrest among the workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC140701;A dark and terrible secret has been brooding among the clergy in $STATENAME$. Whispers in dark corners speak of a deranged priest molesting young children. This pedophile has gone unchecked for quite some time while the rest of the clergy maintained disbelief. Now he is being shuffled about, moved from one parish to another, in order to cover up the story and secure the church's reputation. Rumours of his existence are spreading throughout the populace and the church is begging us to let them handle the matter. They claim that a public hearing would cause their flock to lose faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA140701;If the church will not provide justice, the state gallows will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC140801;One of the larger places of worship for our predominant faith in $STATENAME$ has started construction on an expansion. The construction workers have discovered a previously unknown graveyard on the expansion's land that houses the dead of a religious minority. The minority's leaders have insisted that the government halt the expansion. Doing so will appease the minority, but the clergy and moralists will be upset that a chance to put our faith forcefully above all others was missed, especially since the ground has already been consecrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC140901;In order to emphasize the multi-religious makeup of $STATENAME$ and the law's relationship with the divine, a courthouse in $STATENAME$ has taken upon itself to install a series of reliefs along its walls detailing great lawbringers from various faiths.

EVTDESC141001;A teenage girl was found beaten and raped in a cultural minority's section of a city in $STATENAME$. Since the authorities have no leads, members of our primary culture have taken it upon themselves to seek retribution on the minority and anti-minority sentiments are becoming widespread. The local government has turned a blind eye to the whole matter and let the attacks of retribution be carried out. Many people in $STATENAME$ are now calling for severe restrictions to be placed upon the minorities in the nation. Bringing the retribution-seeking attackers to justice probably will not abate the anti-minority sentiments. However, we could falsify an investigation into the rape and claim it was in fact not committed by a minority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC141101;Minorities in $STATENAME$ are starting to gather and protest over the right to own property. Dishonest landowners in the state have repeatedly abused the minorities by collecting rent and then evicting them on false charges. The minorities have little legal recourse as their rights are almost non-existant. Recently, a family of immigrants who were wrongfully evicted from their residence died from exposure during an extremely cold night. Newspapers have picked up the story and are inflaming public opinion against our residency laws. We could let the anti-residency sentiments grow," or we could pay off some newspapers to run an opposing story detailing the ""uncouth and devious"" nature of the minority's culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC141201;Minorities in $STATENAME$ have gradually lifted themselves out of poverty and into the middle class. They have started their own sports organizations, newspapers, and religious centers. A particularly racist and sharply divided town in $STATENAME$ has voted in a series of laws that effectively bans a large minority's most important cultural festival. The laws probably would not have garnered enough votes if cultural minorities were allowed to vote. The debate about spreading full citizenship to minorities is raging among the state's newspapers and those in favor of full citizenship seem to be gaining the most sympathy. To stop this movement we could stage an arson attack on the racist town's city hall and make it look like the minority was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE9.T;The Prague Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE9.D;After having reaffirmed his hegemony over the various principalities of the Holy Roman Empire, the emperor, Sigismund V has issued a Proclamation destined to all the members of the Imperial Diet. Determined to pursue the reforms of centralization advocated by his father Wenceslaus VIII during the German Wars, the emperor asks all the princes of the empires to join in a single state from the Danube to the Elbe. Should the Empire be centralized it would mean an upheaval of the balance of powers on the continent but nothing is set in stone for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410009.A;Send the Proclamation !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE10.T;The Reactions towards the Proclamation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE10.D;The Proclamation has had various results throughout the Empire. Already all the good princes have joined the Reich !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410010.A;How did we fare ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE11.T;The Prague Proclamation : Success ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE11.D;The majority of the princes and free cities of the Empire have accepted the Proclamation. The discordant voices are alone amongst this common sentiment. The Emperor is really now the king of the Germans and to give them guarantees he already moved his court to Frankfurt am Main where all the institutions will be centralized. However this move has angered the Bohemians who don’t accept to be the heart of the Empire and the idea of secession is brewing in the mind of some. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410011.A;Long live the unified Holy Roman Empire !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE12.T;The Prague Proclamation : Complete Failure ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE12.D;Instead of achieving a centralized empire the Proclamation launched the contrary move. All German princes ahve united and are marching toward Prague !;;;;;;;;;;;;;

HRE50.T;Bohemian nationalism ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE50.D;"Lion over Eagle!" "We are no Germans!" "Down with the traitor!" These and many more shouts can be heard almost everyday in Prague, Pilsen, Brünn,...The Bohemian people feel betrayed by the recent development in the realm and they fear that their privileged position they have been enjoying as citizens of the Imperial heartland for centuries is waning. Is it a sign of things to come ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410050.A;I fear we have awaken something ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE51.T;Bohemian riots;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE51.D;It started as a meaningless brawl. One drunk Bohemian anti-Imperialist was loudly swearing and a nearby walking police officer tried to calm him down, only to be punched to the face. When the officer tried to defend himself, the drunk pulled a knife, the policeman panicked and shot him in the chest. Other Bohemians seeing that promptly killed the officer, stormed a close weapons depot and started building a barricade in one of the city's streets. Looks like trouble is brewing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410051.A;They can complain, it's not like they'll get any results;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE54.T;The Bohemian Revolution !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE54.D;"To arms! To arms! For our freedom and our pride! Down with the German tyranny!" After a series of incidents following the unification of the Holy Roman Empire and the subsequent centralisation acts, the situation in Bohemia escalated in a full-blown crisis. Bohemian aristocrats formed a national assembly and declared the Bohemian Crown Lands independent from the rest of the Empire. Disgruntled Bohemians, joined by many veteran soldiers of Holy Roman armies are already flocking to their ranks, gearing for war. Is peace in central Europe really a dream impossible to come true?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410054.A;When one attacks the Empire, the Empire strikes back !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE55.T;Intervention in Mitteleuropa ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE55.D;With the Bohemians rebelling, we have a chance to cripple the Kaiserreich. For glory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410055.A;We will 'support' the Bohemians !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE56.T;Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE56.D;At last we have succeeded. The war cost us many lives but we have secured our homeland from the traitor Kaiser ! Let it be known that Bohemia will never bow again before the Germans !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410056.A;We have vainquished the Emperor !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE57.T;Bohemian Mobilisation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE57.D;Now it is obvious that the war between the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia will be fought on a scale never seen before. The Bohemian citizens are en masse joining the Free Corps and donating their belongings to the war effort. The story of a girl who, having no other property or money, donated a lock of her hair is just one of the many. The Bohemian lion is now standing tall, ready to take on his enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410057.A;We shall be free from the Emperor's yoke !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE58.T;Prague is lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE58.D;Ein Reich, ein Deutschland. That's easier to say than to fulfil. The Bohemians decided not to be just regular members of the Holy Roman Empire and somehow managed to defeat our newborn country, striking a deep wound into its flesh. With the blue-red-white tricolour flying over the Prague Castle, they have lost the chance to be full citizens of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410058.A;Bohemia is lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE59.T;The Revolution was crushed !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE59.D;Ein Reich, ein Deutschland. Only fools would want to stand against the wind of destiny. The foolish Bohemians have tried to do just that and paid the price of blood for it. But our Empire has bled, too, and so it is important that the peace shall now rule in Mitteleuropa for eternity. And thanks only to our glorious nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410059.A;The Revolution was crushed !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE60.T;The new Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE60.D; The war is over and won. The national assembly is now to be dissolved and replaced with a proper form of government. The only question now stands - what form it shall take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410060.A;For the people ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410060.B;For the King !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOHR.T;Bohemian Rhapsody;;;;;;;;;;;;;
BOHR.D;The composer Smetana has published his new opus, 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. This little romantic music has been a great success at the court in Prague and musicians from the whole world are now playing it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410070.A;I heard that you could hear that even in Zanzibar!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE71.T;The 1100th anniversary of the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HRE71.D;In the Year of the Lord 800, Karl the Great, King of the Franks, was crowned Roman Emperor by the Pope in Rome invocating the Translatio Imperii, and thus claiming the inheritance of the old Empire. The Empire would disappear for a few decades because of wars between the Karling kings but would be revived by Otto I in 967. Today marks the celebration of the crowning of Charlemagne and show the resiliency of the Empire, which has however deeply evolved over the centuries to become an Empire of the German Nation. The Emperor will attend mass in the Palatine Chapel, the personal Church of Karl der Grosse in memory of the Father of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
410071.A;May it live for a thousand year more!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN1.T;An Hungarian Envoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN1.D;The Holy Crown of Saint Stefen is the most important relics of Hungary. No Hungarian King could really be considered worthy of ruling until he had been crowned with this very Crown. The Kings of Bohemia have been in control of the Crown since the Ottoman Conquest, transferring the Crown in Prague where it would not be threatened. But the Dukes of Nitra we established to protect our lands proclaimed themselves Kings of Hungary following the expelling of the Turks. Gabriel I of Hungary has come to ask us to relinquish the Crown once and for all and is ready to “give in to any demands”.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265401.A;Give the Crown to him, we want a good neighbour in Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265401.B;Ask him to bow in Prague, before Us;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265401.C;Ask him to relinquish Nitra as a March between our Kingdoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265401.E;The Crown is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN2.T;Bohemian Answer;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN2.D;The Emperor has granted our request without any demands ! The Crown has been escorted to Budapest where Gabor I was formally crowned King of Hungary. It will surely inaugurate a new period of peace between our Kingdoms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265402.A;Excellent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN3.D;The Emperor will only relinquish the Crown if we go to Prague and kneel before him. This move would damage our international status but we need it to secure our Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265403.A;Accept for the good of Hungary...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265403.B;Try to recover it by 'other means'...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265403.C;We don't need it after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN4.T;Humiliation of Hungary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN4.D; After negotiations the King of Hungary has come to Prague to regain the Holy Crown of Saint Stefen. The most precious relic of the Kingdom was only given to Gabor I after he knelt before the Bohemian Emperor in an humiliating ceremonial. The move has critically damaged the international standing of the Hungarian Kingdom along with their relations with Bohemia. One can guess that Bohemia made a serious enemy of her neighbour…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265404.A;All is well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN5.T;End of negotiations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN5.D;The King of Hungary has refused our offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265405.A;The Crown is ours then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN6.D;The Bohemian Emperor has asked us to release a semi-independent Duchy of Nitra in exchange of the Crown of San Stefen. Nitra was the march installed by the Jagiellon to protect the Empire from Turkish attacks but it was ruled by Hungarian noblemen following the marriage between Charles Bethven and Maria Jagiellon, duchess of Nitra. The Hungarian revolution saw the duke of Nitra become King of Hungary by popular demands but it felt like an insult for Prague. Giving up full control on the duchy will surely be a thorn for our Kingdom but we would gain the Holy Crown…;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265406.A;Give in to their demands...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265406.B;We'll find 'another way'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265406.C;We don't need it after all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN7.T;The New Duchy of Nitra;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN7.D;At our demand the King of Hungary has offered autonomy to the Slovaks and we have been allowed a right to intervene in their affairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265407.A;Excellent;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN8.D;The Bohemians have refused to give us the Crown and they will refuse all concessions we might offer...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265408.A;Try to recover it at all costs!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265408.B;It's hopeless...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN9.T;Prague Heist!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN9.D;Stupor has struck Prague after an attempt by Hungarian nationalists to gain the Holy Crown! A dozen of Hungarian plotters bribed their way in the Castle of Prague and killed at least 27 guards before being caught. The question made them reveal that they were helped by the Hungarian government after the failure of negotiations to gain the Holy Crown. Such a slanderous behaviour needs to be addressed firmly without waiting for ‘apologies’. We’ll make Hungary pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265409.A;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN10.T;Heist Failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN10.D;Our government had secretly funded Magyar nationalists to steal the Holy Crown in Prague and bring it to Budapest but the Heist did not go as planned. Now Bohemian Forces are mobilizing and we must now march to Prague and take back the Crown!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265410.A;And they said it could not backfire....;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN11.T;Coronation of Gabor I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HUN11.D;Gabor I Bethmen was solemnly crowned yesterday in Budapest by the archbishop with the Holy Crown of St Stefen! Despite the difficulty we are now possessing once again our most precious jewel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Though they took on many aspects of a writting system,by being able to indicate placenames for example,they were far more unwieldy than a book. Pachacuti worked with the Quipucamayocs,or those who knew how to read the quipu,""to transcribe all of the knowledge contained in the quipu into the new Quechua alphabet he had adopted. This knowledge was then used as the basis for the new madatory school system he adopted, along with western science and technological education.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

The case has been brought to the national scene in parliamentary debates over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pensions system, where reform-minded MPs have used the case as a bat with which to beat the government for not doing more to help the old and disabled.;;Ist es, so frage ich diese Regierung, richtig, dass ein Mann mit einem Leben harter und ehrlicher Arbeit ohne Hilfe oder Zuwendung einfach so den Unbillen des Schicksals überlassen wird?'\n\nEin Bauer in einem unserer Staaten hatte einen beinahe tödlichen Dreschunfall, der ihn für sein Leben behinderte und entstellte. Der Fall kam ins nationale Rampenlicht durch Parlamentsdebatten um das $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Rentensystem, welches von reformwilligen Parlamentariern als Keule benutzt wurde, die Regierung dafür zu verprügeln, dass sie nicht mehr für Alte und Versehrte tut.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC3301;As our average life expectancies have increased over the years, more and more families have had to take care of their elderly who are no longer able to provide for themselves. The social makeup of our country is changing, and without much in way of a national plan for the elderly and the disabled, a lot are falling between the cracks in the system. Conservatives have by and large taken the stance that the family is the first and last social support structure for the elderly, and that an increasing role for government in the area threatens to unravel important societal bonds. Liberals, on the other hand, see our pensions as tragically lacking, pointing to the many who, seemingly, go without aid.;;Mit steigender Lebenserwartung über die Jahre hinweg müssen immer mehr Familien sich um ihre älteren Familienmitglieder kümmern, die nicht länger für sich selbst sorgen können. Das soziale Gefüge unseres Landes ändert sich, und ohne einen nationalen Plan für die Alten und Versehrten fallen viele durch die Lücken des Systems. Konservative haben im Allgemeinen den Standpunkt eingenommen, dass die Familie die erste und letzte Unterstützung für die Alten ist, und dass eine größere Rolle der Regierung hierbei droht, wichtige soziale Bindungen aufzulösen. Liberale, auf der anderen Seite, sehen einen tragischen Mangel an Renten und verweisen auf die vielen Menschen, die scheinbar ohne Hilfe auskommen müssen.;;;;;;;;;;;

Gruel.'\n\nThe pensions system has been on everyone's lips and minds the past week, with the publication of a parliamentary report on the pensions system. The report is fairly nuanced in its overall conclusions about the system, but the issue that has stuck with people is an attached case-study interview with an elderly gentleman left out of the pensions system on what seems like mere technicalities, who complains about having worked hard all his life, but now being fed nothing but gruel.;;Mein janzes Leben hann isch hart jearbeitet, un wat krie' isch nu dafür?

Der Bericht ist generell sehr nuanciert in seinen Schlussfolgerungen über das System, aber was den Menschen im Gedächtnis haften bleibt, ist eine angefügte Fallstudie - ein Interview mit einem älteren Herrn, der aus bloßen technischen Gründen durch das Rentennetz fiel, und der sich beschwert, sein Leben lang hart gearbeitet zu haben, aber nun nichts als Grütze zu essen bekommt.;;;;;;;;;;;

Yet, now, when my life draws to more peaceful ends, I cannot help but notice that I am old.'\n\nWhile life expectancies in $COUNTRY$ are decidedly on the increase, the unfortunate interaction between a relatively low wage, and equally low pensions, means that very few people can afford to make preparations for an old age where they are no longer capable of working. The educated middle classes would prefer to see a raise in the minimum wage, while the aristocracy argues in favor of raising pensions.;;Seit ich ein Junge war, bin ich marschiert - mein ganzes Leben lang.

Others are less convinced by these arguments, and claim instead that they violate the fundamental economic principles and operations of the free market.;;Mit steigenden Lebensstandards in $COUNTRY$ sind mehr und mehr Menschen der unteren Schichten der Ansicht, dass sie eine größere Portion vom neuen Reichtum unseres Landes erhalten sollten.

They claim that the system is needlessly bureaucratic, and could be reformed. The reforms they suggest would, however, mean an effective abolishment of the system.;;Wie man so richtig sagt: 'Was ein verzwicktes Netz wir doch weben'.

The general feeling of the cabinet is that we should consider our minimum wage legislation, but there is also a faction arguing that it might, in fact, be better to go in the opposite direction;;Und während ich nicht behaupte, alle Arbeiter in $COUNTRY$ zu repräsentieren, so behaupte ich doch, dass ich zumindest einige von ihnen repräsentiere, und die erzählen mir, dass wir bessere Löhne brauchen.

The oligarchs fled to Savoy after the Dorian supporters proclaimed the Republic of Liguria. However after we signed peace with Aragon the oligarchs were soon put back by a joint Anglois-Savoyard coalition and Andrea Doria and its government fled to Firenze where he has lived since..

ITA1.D;The Mezzogiorno has been freed from Aragon but the differences with the rest of Italy are still important.

This terrorist organisation has been created by the Kaiganese who are the descendants of Korean and Japanese liberals who fled Asia for what they considered a forgotten haven. But the Empire has strengthened its rule over its colony and they have decided to act to obtain an independent Kaiganese Republic.

Here I am, thousands of years later, a less free man than were they, back then.'\n\nThe 19th century saw a resurgence of interest in the Ancient Classics. Many of the ancient societies, Rome and Greece, were looked to for inspiration by liberal thinkers seeing in them proto examples and experiments in those same traditions of freedom that they sought to implement in the modern era. A local Reform Club has republished some select pieces of ancient literature that are becoming high fashion among the educated elites of $COUNTRY$;"Lorsque je lis des écrits sur l'Athènes de Périclès, la progressivité de ces anciennes sociétés me surprend toujours. Et me voici, des milliers d'années plus tard, moins libre que les hommes de l'époque"".\n\nLe XIXe siècle vit un regain d'intérêt pour le classicisme ancien. Bon nombre de sociétés anciennes parmi lesquelles Rome et la Grève suscitèrent l'intérêt de penseurs libéraux qui voyaient là de beaux exemples de liberté qu'ils avaient à cœur d'appliquer à l'ère moderne. Un Club de la réforme local a publié quelques écrits de littérature ancienne, écrits très appréciés des élites éduquées de $COUNTRY$";Und wenn ich über das Athen des Perikles lese, versetzt mich die Fortschrittlichkeit dieser antiken Gesellschaften immer wieder in Erstaunen. Und hier stehe ich, Tausende Jahre später, und genieße weniger Freiheit als sie damals.'\n\nIm neunzehnten Jahrhundert kam wieder starkes Interesse an den antiken Klassikern auf. Viele liberale Denken suchten Inspiration in den antiken Gesellschaften Roms und Griechenlands, die sie als Urbeispiele und -experimente derselben Freiheitstraditionen ansahen, die sie in der Moderne etablieren wollten.

EVTDESC15300;Originally founded in 1862 as a Czech gymnastics movement in Prague, the Sokol movement soon spread further to other Slavic countries. While in theory a non-partisan organisation, the Sokol movement was in practice an important vehicle for the furthering of Czech nationalism and, later on, pan-slavic thought and ideology. The movement aimed to provide its members with comprehensive training of both mind and body, and its locales often acted as important forums for the dissemination of radical nationalist thought, for which it was several times surpressed by authorities.;;Die ursprünglich im Jahr 1862 in Prag als tschechische Turnbewegung gegründete Bewegung breitete sich schon bald auf andere slawische Länder aus. Während es sich bei der Sokol-Bewegung theoretisch um eine unparteiische Organisation handelte, war sie tatsächlich ein wichtiges Medium zur Förderung des tschechischen Nationalismus und später panslawischer Gedanken und Ideologien. Die Bewegung hatte das Ziel, ihre Mitglieder geistig wie körperlich umfassend auszubilden. Ihre Lokalitäten fungierten oft als wichtige Foren zur Verbreitung radikal-nationalistischen Gedankenguts, was auch der Grund war, weshalb sie mehrfach behördlich unterdrückt wurde.;;;;;;;;;;;

NAV1.T;Basque Independence ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
NAV1.D;Navarra is at the centre of influence conflicts since the Renaissance. Forsaken by the Spanish Crown which pursued its exploration policies, Navarra was both coveted by the king of Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy. Aragon attacked first and invaded Higher-Navarra in 1508. The queen from Navarra fled to her possessions in Aquitaine, Lower-Navarra. Before war erupted, a compromise was found between Aragon and the Dual-Monarchy in Perpignan : The Anglo-French would annex Lower-Navarra while the queen of Navarra would pledge fidelity to the king of Aragon. Over the centuries, the political setup did not change much, with Navarra using both kingdoms against each other to preserve some independence, like with Henri III who took part in the Wars of Religion. But now, Aragon is the shadow of itself, not even considered as a Great Power by many. The king Henry IV thinks he can profit from it, by pulling his Anglo-French allies to help him.

EVTNAME800147;Sepoy Rebels Force Concessions;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800147;The Indian subcontinent has been overwhelmed by the Sepoy rebels. Our garrisons are in retreat, and our colonial governors have already fled for safer ports. We have no choice but to give into their demands, many of which involve removing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence from any of the nations we have subjugated over the years of our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
800147.A;We have no choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800148;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Driven Out of South Asia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800148;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ presence in South Asia has come to an end, thanks to the spread of the Sepoy Rebellion.

800148.A;We never liked $FROMCOUNTRY$ anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800149;Rebels Storm $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800149;After a swarm of violence and looting that engulfed the entire nation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rioters have stormed the capital. The government has been forced to make numerous concessions, in a desperate bid to calm the people. So far it seems to have worked, and has spared many leaders from being executed by angry mobs, but it remains to be seen whether these concessions will only cause more problems in the end than they solved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97700;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and have gained control of the capital. They send word they wish to bring all our lost provinces back to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

800151.B;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800152;Provinces Brought Under Control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800152;With the patriot rebellion now over, our provinces have now been brought under control and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors are once again in command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC800055;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ goverment has been overthrown, and the rebel government has declared themselves free from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.

EVTNAME97562;$CAPITAL$ Burns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97562;$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties-- no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$'s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97562.A;We have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97566;Trouble in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97566;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is besieged by rebels, and threatens to fall if they do not receive assistance from $COUNTRY$. They warn us that if the rebels are successful, it's very likely that $FROMCOUNTRY$ would cease to be in $COUNTRY$'s sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97570;Native Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97570;Now that $COUNTRY$ is free, native $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens are beginning to protest against the colonial regime that still remains. Foreigners still hold the highest positions in the government, and have a privileged status in comparison to those they once ruled over as a colony. In $PROVINCENAME$, the recent arrest of a native for trespassing on the estate of a foreigner has led to riots-- and dissension has spread throughout all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

There is, of course, a risk that our efforts could be discovered and bring war down upon us. Should we help them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
800100.A;We must free our brethren.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97175.A;This cannot be allowed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97180.A;We will assume control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97180.B;It is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97181;Colonial Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97181;We have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SS1.T;History of the Dual-Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS1.D;The execution of Joan of Arc would come to mark the beginning of the end for the French Wars of Succession (1337-1498), as the Armagnac Party would never again rise to what it once was. The Valois and their allies would fight on for another seventy years, but with the victory of Edward the Red Prince at Vichy the future of a Dual Monarchy of France and England was secured, only being confirmed with the 1498 Treaty of Rome. The threat of encirclement with the Marriage of Anne of Brittany with Jean III of Burgundy, led to the breakdown of the Anglo-Burgundian alliance in 1490 when, unable to challenge the marriage, invaded Brittany during the Anglo-Franco-Breton War (1490-1492). Burgundy, unable to provide support against France due to rebellion fermented by the House of Lorraine, forced Brittany's surrender. While it was too late to annul the marriage, with Jean having consummated it, the Treaty of Le Verger effectively saw Brittany annexed into the French crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145001.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS2.D;The Reformation presented new challenges to the unity of the thrones. The deep involvement of the Valois in aiding Zwingli's escape from Papal and Imperial imprisonment was too good a pretext to end any alternate succession, causing the Languedoc War (1532), and ending with the conquest of Languedoc & Auvergne, leaving only a rump Provencal state in the Azure Coast and in Rhone. In addition to the affairs of Provence, it also engaged in what became known as the Great Game with the Kingdom of Burgundy and the Crown of Aragon. The subject of these wars of influence came about with Navarre (which saw the conquest of the County of Foix & Bearn in 1516), the Italian Peninsula (which ended largely as a victory for the Aragonese, as most of the Peninsula, save Savoy, Genoa, Milan, and the Emilian Dukedoms fell under their influence, compared to only Savoy for the Dual Monarchy), and even the County of Provence (which easily fell into the Aragonese camp to save them from being destroyed by the Plantagenets.);;;;;;;;;;;;;
145002.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS3.D;While aggressively fighting heresy abroad the Kings of Both Thrones were initially tolerant of Protestants. King Francois I was torn between dynastic links to the firmly Catholic Jagiellons of Bohemia and a large portion of his populace firm in their new faith. Further strife in England and in Aquitaine combined with the growing threat of Burgundy (long the champion of the Protestant cause) tipped the balance leading first to the Anglo-French Wars of Religion (1598-1614) both within the Kingdom and among its neighbors, and later after the defeat of the Protestants, the Exodus of the Protestant Huguenots to Burgundy, Scandinavia and Colonial New Burgundy (now the Seven Republics) and the Anglican Father Pilgrim and their followers to what they would call New England (now Beornia).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145003.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS4.D;While England was briefly a viceroyalty under the Dukes of Gloucester, the throne would be forever undivided following the dissolution of the English Parliament by Henry VII in 1537, and its merging into the Estates General. The nobility with the exception of some distant provinces converged increasingly to Paris as French, became the official language throughout both kingdoms. This led to the gradual Francification of England as once English names were increasingly replaced by French. By the turn of the 19th century, French has become the primary common language in the Southern parts of England. The concept of a centralized Parliamentary body was revolutionary for its time, and, almost ironically, would influence the future legislative bodies of the Burgundian Estates-General, the Savoyard Subalpine Senate, the Aragonese Cortes and the Scandinavian Riksdag, among other European states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145004.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS5.D;The Anglo-French history in Ireland was also something of a peculiar moment. During the French Wars of Succession, English, and later Anglo-French control of the Island was left in the hands of the House of Fitzgerald, the Earls of Kildare as much time was spent in building a new administrative apparatus for both England and France. Because of this, the Kildares, along with the House of Desmond, both began to rule Ireland as if it was their own Kingdom. The issues, which had been building up during the twilight years of the reign of Henri VIII culminated in the three Irish Wars (1573-1579, 1583-1594 and the Nine Years’ War, 1598-1607). Which gradually saw Ireland pacified, the rebel Irish Lords killed and the King of England and France reaffirmed as Lord of Ireland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145005.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS6.D;With the unexpected ascension of James IV of Scotland to the Throne of the North in 1500 the Plantagenêts faced the threat of encirclement by the alliance of Burgundy and the former. The exodus of the early 17th century was compounded by wars against Burgundy and Scandinavia pushing emigration to the colonies of Plantagenia and Amazonie. However the pushing towards these colonies were not without strife there as well, as conflicts were rife between Colonial Vinland and New Burgundy, as well as against the Cherokee and Creek, among other First Nation Tribes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145006.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS7.D;Eventually, the Dual Monarchy secured its position as the unquestioned power in Western Europe amid the gradual decline of Spain. A period of relative peace in Europe allowed the Dual Monarchy to expand its influences abroad. The Dual Monarchy established trading posts along the coast of Sierra Lionne, allowed them to trade European goods for slaves to be sent to the New World. A series of wars with the Kingdom of Kandy (1696-1703, 1705-1715, 1716-1717) saw the entirety of Ceylon becoming an Anglo-French crown colony, allowing access to the Indian Ocean Trade through good relations with the Nasirid Sultans of Bengal. At the same time there was a great degree of expansion in the Anglo-French colonies in the New World, as colonial conflicts with Scandinavia, Burgundy and Spain, reinforced its mother country’s position. This period of colonial expansion was broken with the War of the Anglo-French Succession, leading to the independence of Plantagenia under a cadet branch of the House of Plantagenêt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145007.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS8.D;Remaining largely aloof during the opening stages of the Great German Wars allowed the industrial revolution to take hold and the Dual Monarchy seemed set to dominate this new realm as well. But the battles of the later war quickly demonstrated that the old rival Burgundy was again on the rise as even beaten and battered it remained victorious, losing only its other colony Amazonie to independence. The Dual Monarchy enters the middle of the 19th century as the ultimate global power, but for the first time in over a century its position does not appear unassailable in Anvers and courts beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145008.A;Here I come !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS10.T;History of Burgundy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS10.D;Following the Congress of Arras, Philip of Burgundy swore fealty to Henry VI but extracted a high price. While still obligated to come to his liege's aid in time of war Philip secured for himself and his heirs full exemption from taxation and full command of his own vassals and levies. Hence began Burgundy's rise to true independence. English actions over the following decades continued to jeopardize the relationship as Burgundy felt it bore a disproportionate cost in the war, while the English took its aid for granted.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145010.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS11.D;With the death of Philip, his son Charles would pursue an aggressive and independent policy greatly expanding his realm earning him the epithet "the Bold". Through campaigns across southern France and up and down the Rhine, by his death he would secure the addition of the entirety of the Low Countries, Alsace, Lorraine, and the northern Rhine including Cologne, Trier, Mainz, and the Palatinate, as well as the crown and title Rex Burgundicum. While much of the realm remained officially in the Empire or in fief to France, never again would a Burgundian bow to Paris or Prague. To secure this new throne the Burgundians began to quietly back their distant relatives the Valois against their former lieges the Plantagenets.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145011.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS12.D;Zwingli proved popular in much of the realm and the kingdom welcomed a stream of refugees as the Dual Monarchy dismantled much of the Valois’ remnants in the Languedoc War (1532). The burning of Zwingli at the stake in 1527 sent Burgundy firmly down the path of Protestantism as it confronted its newly confirmed enemies the Jagiellons and Plantagenets. The accession of Philippe IV to the Burgundian throne in 1528 saw ties to the former Duchy are cut as he moved the capital from Dijon to Anvers in the Low Countries. The new King also began pursuing a policy of aggressive defense of Protestantism in the Empire, becoming its champion with support from the Stuarts of Scandinavia. Explicitly ignoring the Treaty of Pamplona, Burgundian settlements are established in both Ameriga and Arcadia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145012.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS13.D;The Wars of Religion begin to kick off in earnest amid Burgundy's new policy of supporting any Protestant monarch in defense of his throne (often interpreted where convenient to include lesser claimants). While maintaining a level of civility with the Dual Monarchy, Burgundy pursues a series of proxy wars in northwestern Italy which, although lost, serve to further confirm Burgundian supremacy in arms if not local politics. Open warfare against the Emperors in Central Germany made Burgundy the recognized leader of the central German Protestants while her close ally Scandinavia dominated in the north. Caught between the Turks and Protestants, Bohemia and her allies slowly lost ground on both fronts in a series of wars through the 16th and early 17th century, much to Burgundy's benefit. Burgundy's armies exhausted by decades of constant fighting began to give way, and despite the inability to dominate Germany, they were able to secure religious freedom and thus, they hoped, a long peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145013.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS14.D;The enrichment of the Dutch and Flemish merchant houses through loans to the government and monopolies on Atlantic trade brought great benefits. It financed unparalleled technological development at home and led to the first trade ventures east securing the first Burgundian footholds in the Indian Ocean. With several decades of peace Burgundy looked inward for the most part though trade ventures secured footholds on the Cape and in Southeast Asia. Increasingly overshadowed by her neighbor the Dual Monarchy, Burgundy sought to shore up her support in the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145014.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS15.D;The unexpected events of the Revolution in Frankfurt forced Burgundy into the unusual position of backing the Emperor in his crackdown as the rebels turned on the aristocracy at large. But as the Catholic League showed its intent to abuse the support to secure its position, Burgundy started the defining war of the time, the Great German War (1796-1820). As armies marched across the Empire new states rose and fell through the decades as the unprecedented bloodshed continued and all Europe was drawn in. Nationalism's dread rise threatened the integrity of Burgundy as a state, but ultimately it emerged victorious above the other European powers with its territory intact at the head of a new alliance of western Imperial states set to march proudly into the 19th century.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145015.A;Is that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS20.T;History of Gran Colombia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS20.D;Spanish Colonization of the Americas did not begin in earnest until the accession of Alfonso XII, when the first outpost would be established in 1496 in the Island of Cuba, named Santiago after the Mythological Saint James the Moor-slayer. By the end of the first quarter of the 16th century, the Spanish had already established a series of colonial holdings in Cuba. The first expedition into the mainland of the New World came in 1517, when Cuban governor Diego Velázquez commissioned a small Spanish fleet to explore the Yucatan Peninsula (the future Captaincy General of Mayapan), led by Hernández de Cordóba. There they would meet the local natives of the Mayan city of Cape Catoche.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145020.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS21.D;The Spaniards read to them the Requirement of 1513 to them, which offered the natives the protection under the King of Spain should they submit to them. However they were refused and caused a great incident to occur, which saw many a Spaniard killed or forced to flee. Two years later a second attempt to explore the mainland came in 1519, this time it was a larger force that landed in Central Mexico. This force would find themselves allied with various natives, in what the latter saw was a great opportunity to overthrow the oppressive and brutal Aztec Triple Alliance. The Spanish Conquistador force, led by Hernan Cortes, would join with various Mesoamerican tribes such as the Tarascans and the Tlaxcalans in battle, defeating the Aztecs in Otumba and sacking the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, razing it to the ground and building a new capital, Mexico City, which would become the seat of the Viceroyalty of New Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145021.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS22.D;From the conquest and subjugation of the Aztecs followed further conquests, first of former allies in Mesoamerica, then of the Mayans, who of which resisted for much of the 16th century, despite being largely under Spanish control by the late 1520’s, and even down into what would be Granada. Ultimately, they would be stopped by two formidable forces. To the south was the Empire of Tawantinsuyu, whom, despite having to deal with a Civil War, was able to repulse and humiliate the Spaniards, a feat further strained due to official support from the Dong Guo City-States as well as the Dual Monarchy of England-France. Attempts at expansion northwards was also met with dismal failure, first by the Dong-Guo City States, who humiliated the Spanish at the Battle of Yongle in 1544, and was further reined in by the Anglo-French encroachment deeper into the Arcadian continent as the Viceroyalty of Plantagenia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145022.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS23.D;Colonial life saw Gran Colombian society divided into a series of castes. At the top were the Peninsulares, the peoples born in Spain.. Under them were the Criollos, citizens born in the colonies to full Peninsularies and Creole families. Between the two were the colonial government dominated by, with respect to the King of Spain. Below them are the Mestizos and Mulattos, who are citizens of mixed Spanish and Native American/African ancestry, and finally at the bottom are the Native peoples and African slaves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145023.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS24.D;The Viceroyalty was originally established with control over the entire territory from Lusitania to Cusco. This would change with the Beja Reforms instituted in the late 18th century during the reign of King Manuel and King Jose. These reforms saw an attempt to centralize the Spanish Empire to the person of the Absolutist King of Spain. This included partitioning the Viceroyalty of New Spain into four, Lusitania in the North, San Salvador in Mesoamerica, Granada in Ameriga, and a rump Viceroyalty of New Spain in control of Mexico and Cuba. The government would be ruled exclusively by peninsulaires, who in theory would be disinterested, these peninsulaires being military men who had long records of military service. Clergymen, audencia judges and governor-generals were also staffed by peninsulaires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145024.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS25.D;This disenfranchisement by the King, coupled with economic forms working against the colonials, among other issues led to ideas of independence and self-government to spread. The tip off was the renegade priest Miguel Hidalgo’s Cry of Dolores speech, which would kick off what would eventually become the Spanish American Wars of Independence or the Spanish-Colombian War (1815, 1818- ) The conflict brought many peoples together in attempting to remove the Spanish, culminating in the founding of the Colombian Alliance in 1819 under Mexican General Vicente Guerrero. Over the course of the three year campaign, the revolutionaries were able to successfully liberate Mexico (the Second Mexican Republic, the First having been crushed immediately after its founding in 1815), and Lusitania (The Lusitanian Republic) before being decisively defeated in the Battle of San Salvador on 16 September 1822, ultimately leading to the first armistice, signed in Veracruz at the end of the month.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145025.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS26.D;Meanwhile in Ameriga, a group of revolutionaries seized control of the New Granadan Viceregal capital of Cartagena, and declared the creation of the Republic of Granada (the precursor to Santandera). Led by Simon Bolivar, the new Republic began its own waves of conquest, incorporated the Governor-Generalate of Quito and Arequipa in the Andes. This coupled with the restarting of the Mexican advance into Guatemala, saw the rebirth of the Colombian Alliance, now with the Amerigan Republics added to this group. By the end of 1828, the Spanish were now reduced to their holdings in Cuba, Nueva Castilla & Essequibo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145026.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS27.D;Desperate, the colonial governor of Granada called upon the support of the Inca under their leader, Huayna Capac IV. This Inca Intervention (1829-1832), initially tipped the battle in Spain’s favor, as Peru was coming under siege. But they were decisively defeated as Lima, seeing the death of Simon Bolivar as a result. The Inca continued their conflict under the new Colombian Supreme Leader, and Bolivar’s protege, Francisco de Paula Santander, but the latter’s death upon the removal of the Inca from Peru saw the Alliance become centralized and dominated by Granadan general Francisco de Miranda. However, to reassure the peoples of Mexico, Lusitania and Mesoamerica, Miranda established a Tetrarchy, bringing in Juan Manuel Santos to represent Mesoamerica, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna to represent Mexico and Manuel Luis de Madeira to represent Lusitania, however Santa Anna would still hold the most power out of the four members.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145027.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS28.D;Under the coalition of Miranda and Santos in 1832, Gran Colombia launched a full-scale assault on Castilla and Essequibo, successfully removing Spanish presence there by 1834. Miranda, now determined to remove the Spanish completely from the Americas, began construction of a Navy, utilized all the naval shipyards the alliance had to offer. This hastily assembled fleet was to carry their army to conquer Cuba, but this move was intercepted by a Large Spanish fleet that had recently arrived at port in Havana. The Battle of Havana, fought on 21 April 1835, was the decisive battle that saw the Colombian Navy smashed and half it’s men going down with their ships.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145028.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS29.D;The battle would be followed up by summer with a massive invasion against the Colombian rebels, seeing Lusitania, the Yucatan and Granada being invaded by the Spanish in a determined effort to end the Colombian independence movement. Miranda, either to better coordinate the alliance, or out of strengthening his power, abolished the republics and united them into a Federal Republic centralized in Mexico City.Despite being corrupted by a power-hungry general, the dream of Independence for the Spanish-speaking peoples of the New World still lingers for those who wish to fight for it. But do the people wish to fight for their freedom, or would they wish to once again be forced under the yoke of Spanish domination??;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145029.A;Here I come!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS30.T;History of Qingqiu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS30.D;The Origin of Qingqiu (Chinese for Clear Autumn) can be traced back to the voyages of Zheng He that was sponsored by the Yongle (1404-1424) and Hongxi (1424-1435) Emperors of Ming China, all of which highlighted the power of the Scholar-Bureaucratic Faction over the Eunuchs. Zheng He would be tasked by the Xuande Emperor to launch an expedition to explore further east after the successful fifth expedition leading to the discovery of Zhourao (OTL Australia). As such in 1430, the expedition would set sail. The journey, which took roughly eight months to achieve, would come to an end when they landed in what would later become known as Sanbao Bay.After leaving some of the peoples there behind, Zheng He would make a return trip to China to report his findings, leaving Lei Shoushan and several troops behind to settle and live in this new world. A second voyage would occur in 1433-1434, bringing more soldiers, but also farmers and miners to Qingqiu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145030.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS31.D;During the trek there, Zheng He decided that something dramatic needed to be done to appease the unhappy passengers to avoid some kind of disaster. He arranged for the fleet to stop and allow people to visit ships other than their own, in an attempt to abate their cabin fever. These became regular events, almost celebrations; typically, the same ships would cluster together each time, forming communities that sustained people through the ordeal of being stuck in ships for months. As a result, when the Chinese made landfall in Sanbao Bay, and with plans for a large expansion inland, it was decided the communities that were formed by the ship clusters would be sent across the coast, forming new cities such as Yongle (named after the Emperor who supported the treasure fleets), Xiazhou & Julinyutan, with the original site of their first departure being named Sanbao, after Zheng He, who would die shortly after the second voyage.;;;;;;;;;;;;
145031.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS32.D;About two years after the Second Landing, more ships arrived from China. They carried no passengers, however – in fact, they carried barely any soldiers. They had come to deliver a message: the Hongxi Emperor had died and his son now ruled as the Xuande Emperor. The new emperor was uninterested in continuing to devote so many financial and military resources to such a distant colony, and ordered the troops to return. His Majesty had disavowed any interest in Qingqiu, and declared that anyone who remained there would no longer be under his protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145032.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS33.D;This caused an uproar in Sanbao, and Lei Shoushan, now leader of the city, sent messages to the other Dong Guo City States, instead of discussing the order of returning to China, instead to demand they swear fealty to him, as the new Emperor of Dong Guo. But neither the other cities, nor even Sanbao, wanted an Emperor, and before any ceremony took place, a coup occurred in Sanbao, killing Lei and forcing the Ming messenger to leave, the latter convinced that their time living in the wilderness had driven them into lunacy. The city-states would come under the administration of the military governors until the 1470’s and 1480’s, when wealthy and influential men took the reigns in power, forming City Councils, with a representative from each city forming what would ultimately become the Council of Twenty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145033.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS34.D;During the late 15th century, Dongese explorers sailed south beyond the lands of Mexico and discovered Twanitsuyu. These explorers would meet with and establish a long-standing trade network with the Incan people, bringing untold wealth to the city-states (most especially the southern-most city Yongle) in exchange for weaponry and arms to the Inca. These proved instrumental in the Inca Civil War (1529-1532) and the subsequent Spanish-Incan War (1532-1537), where the Incans, supported by the Dongese, defeated the Spanish. Spanish attempts to subjugate the city-states directly led to the former’s defeat at the Battle of Yongle, forcing Spain to accept the borders between the city states and New Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145034.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS35.D;Although Qingqiu was safe from any invasion by the sheer expanse of the continent, the powers of Europe viewed the city-states as weak and quizzically outdated. The relationship quickly shifted from trading partners to one of a more exploitative nature. Wealthy businessmen from the colonies were able to buy considerable influence in the courts of individual cities. The period from 1709 to 1762 (often called the Bloody Age) saw Qingqiu mired in conflict as cities were convinced to go to war with each other to benefit easterners thousands of miles away. A company in New Burgundy might convince one city to blockade another favored by Scandinavian merchants, leading the two to go to war while the company profited from the fallout. A Plantegenian aristocrat might arrange for one city state to raid another and pay for “laborers” taken from the captives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145035.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS36.D;By the latter half of the 18th century, the people of Qingqiu were exhausted. The endless, pointless wars had taken their toll and many simply refused the call to arms. Sanbao, and especially Yongle, had been strong enough to resist most outside influence. In 1760 a coalition of European corporations attempted to rally the northern city states to force their interests on the two southern strong-holds. Sanbao and Yongle formed an alliance, defeating several of their neighbors in battle and encouraging rebellions in the farther cities. In the end, the corrupted leaders were deposed, and the city-states signed the treaty of the Brother’s Peace; never again would the people of Qingqiu take arms against one another at the behest of a foreign power.;;;;;;;;;;;;
145036.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS37.D;It is often said that this marks the beginning of a unified Qingqiu. However, conservative elements in the victorious cities wanted to preserve the city-state system. Thus, the settlements remained independent, though in the wake of the Bloody Age the populace began to see a common identity linking them to their neighbors.During the Great German War (1795-1820) and the various Wars of Independence fought across the Western Hemisphere, the Qingquiren people were shocked at the developments of which the nations were becoming independent, even more disconcerting when their direct neighbor to the south, Mexico declared its independence from Spain. Lan Weisheng, a Qingquiren educated in the Western way saw these movements as a reason for the Dongese city states to unite into one united state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145037.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS38.D;While the move was supported by Sanbao (at the time ruled by Weisheng’s father, Lan Biao), Yongle and other city states in the south, it was hotly opposed by the Council of Twenty and the Northern city states, thus leading to what would lead to a brief, bloodless conflict (1811-1812) which ultimately saw the Northern City-States frightened into union due to the increasing encroachment of Vinlandic settlers westward, and the Council of Twenty dissolved in favor of a Federalized government loyal to Sanbao.As the Dongese Cities, now centralized into the Qingqiu Federation, marches forward into the 19th century, one must come to wonder what the future would hold for them. But for those brave sons of Zheng He’s legacy, they hope that they will march for and lead in this brave new world...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145038.A;I have seen stranger things in history!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS40.T;History of Bohemia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS40.D;The end of the Hussite Wars (1419-1434) left Bohemia in ruins. Albert von Habsburg died a year after his coronation in 1438 and the kingdom was inherited by his son Ladislas Postumus. One of the Hussite Bohemian nobles George von Podiebrad gathered an army and took the capital by power and declared himself the Lord Regent. Catholic nobles rose against him and a civil war broke out but George swiftly won. Ladislas was elected in 1453 but died four years after. George was elected as the king. After a long series of negotiating he reached an agreement with the Pope and Bohemia returned back to the Catholic Church. After 14 years, in 1471, George died but before his death he had elected Ladislas II of the Jagiellonian dynasty as a new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145040.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS41.D;In 1480 the Duke of Burgundy, Charles the Bold started his campaign against the Empire. Frederick III von Habsburg was defeated and the Empire turned to Ladislas. He entered the war with the forces of the Kingdom united with those of the Empire. After a Pyrrhic victory in Bohemia's favor at Nieder-Olm in 1483, the peace is signed. Even though the Empire lost the war, Ladislas was seen as a savior of the Germans, and in the Imperial Election of 1486 he decisively defeated Maximilian of Austria. At that moment the Jagiellonian Dynasty ruled in Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Bohemia and Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145041.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS42.D;In 1516 he was succeeded in all his domains by his son Louis. Eight years passed and Suleiman the Magnificent, Emperor of the House of Osman invaded the Middle Europe in a grand campaign. Louis sent a portion of his army to face the Ottoman threat but he underestimated the enemy and in 1526 the combined Bohemian and Hungarian forces were defeated in the Battle of Mohacs and Hungary fell under direct Ottoman control. The aggression turned to a huge threat to the Christendom and Louis rallied a Holy League of Germany, Bohemia, Austria and Poland-Lithuania. They managed to lift the Siege of Brno and reconquer small piece of Royal Hungary. With both sides exhausted the peace is signed in 1530 and the Ottoman hegemony over Hungary would last almost 300 years. Sigismund, second son of Louis, is given the title of the Margrave of Nitra.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145042.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS43.D;Meanwhile in Zurich Zwingli proposed his 95 theses and Louis tried to arrest him at the Diet of Worms but Zwingli managed to escape with the help of the Burgundians. The Protestant started to spread through the Empire as a disease. Louis in response declared himself the Most Catholic King and started to root out the heresy in massive acts of Re-Catholicism and counter-reformation. In 1547 Louis was succeeded as the King of Bohemian Lands and the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by his son Ottokar III who, thanks to his marriage to Elizabeth of Brandenburg - the only heiress of Joachim von Hohenzollern, inherited the Margraviate in 1550. As a true Catholic he began to fought the Protestantism there by supporting Jesuits and the Inquisition. The religious conflicts inside the Empire reached its climax in 1605 when an angry crowd executed the Bohemian-appointed governor of Berlin and declared Brandenburg free. Ottokar IV quickly responded by sending his army to reconquer the Margraviate and restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145043.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS44.D;But the events had already begun to move. An alliance of North German Protestant lords declared themselves the Protestant League. They sought support in both Scandinavia and Burgundy - two major Protestant powers. Scandinavia responded with attack on Pomerania. As a reaction the Catholic league of Bohemia, Austria, Bavaria and Poland was formed. In 1615 in the battle of Neubrandenburg are the Bohemian armies almost annihilated and Scandinavians started their advance to the south. The war seemed lost. But thanks to successful negotiations with then King of the Dual Monarchy, Francis I, England-France entered the war in 1616. The Burgundians sued for peace. Nordic forces were decisively defeated in 1619 in the Battle of Melnik. But the northern naval blockade of the Empire was crippling the trade and so in 1621 the peace was signed in Hamburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145044.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS45.D;Scandinavia annexed Pomerania and abolished the Hansa and Bohemia regained control of Brandenburg and added the Duchy of Saxony to its possessions. The freedom of religion was declared in the Empire. Thanks to the laws accepted in Frankfurt in 1484 the Lands of the Bohemian Crown were excluded from this treaty. Relative stability was reached and the Jagiellonians ruled peacefully for another 150 years. Their dominance in the Empire is threatened only by Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145045.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS46.D;In 1790 the German revolution began but the revolutionaries are defeated by the Imperial Army 5 years after. Wenceslas VIII felt that his position was strong enough to centralize the Empire and achieve the Middle European hegemony. The Scandinavians and Burgundians responded with the declaration of war and starting the Great German War. Military success on the part of Wenceslas VIII, dubbed the "Lion of the North," saw many military victories over the Burgundians and Scandinavians. However, after three decades, Wenceslas VIII was forced to realize that he was unable to achieve Central European hegemony and sued for peace, signed in Frankfurt. The Reichstag was reduced and the Imperial Electorates were dissolved but Bohemian Kings would continue to call themselves the Emperors of the German Nation, and retain hegemony over the remaining Eastern German states. Wenceslas would be murdered the following year and would be succeeded by his son, Sigismund V.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SS50.T;History of Belgium;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS50.D;Burgundian exploration in the New World began as an enterprise to circumvent both the Anglo-French, whose alliance was terminated with their conquest of Brittany in 1492, as well as the Spanish, who had already begun establishing outposts in Cuba. Through contacts and royal support of Dutch and Flemish mercantile and banking clans, beginning with Jean III, and continuing with Philippe IV, there were several exploration projects, discovering the territories around the Northeast Arcadia and Northeast Ameriga. Arcadia in particular would not see settlement by Burgundian and Flemish colonists until the founding of Philippa in 1529. This would be followed with the founding of Nouvelle Bruges and Port Valois in 1535 and 1547, respectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145050.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS51.D;The first trial of the colonization of New Burgundy came with the Italian Religious Wars (1567-1584), a series of direct and indirect conflicts between the Dual Monarchy (who had already established its colonial holdings and centralized them as the Viceroyalty of New France.) Although most of the fighting was restricted to Northwest Italy and Provence, there were a number of engagements at sea, where both Burgundian and Neo Burgundian ships fought to keep the Anglo-French from capturing the nascent Burgundian colonies, which would only be confirmed in the Treaty of Saint-Denis in 1584. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145051.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS52.D;The Treaty of Hamburg that ended the Imperial Wars of Religion (1605-1621), saw Scandinavia ultimately dismantle the Hanseatic League, which was already in decline due to the Scandinavian policy of “Dominium Maris Baltici.” The result of this saw a number of German merchant clans immigrating to Burgundy, and some even to the colonies of New Burgundy and Vinland. These Germano-Septimans would utilize this opportunity, transforming the Burgundian West India Compny into the Neuwelt Hansa (Hanse du Nouveau-Monde in French) in 1669. This move would become the precursor to the federalized nature that would become the Seven Republics.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145052.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS53.D;During the Great German War (1795-1820), the Burgundians saw fit to raise taxes and tariffs in their colonies (a matter that was also done by ally Scandinavia and Spain.) Discontent over taxation without being formally represented in the Burgundian Estates-General led initially to a revolt for greater rights, which ultimately became a conflict over the right to become its own nation. The Neo-Burgundian War of Independence (1802-1805) was decisive, primarily because of Burgundy being trapped in conflict with Bohemia, as colonials quickly swept away Loyalist garrisons. The Treaty of Ghent confirmed this fait accompli, and thus New Burgundy gained independence as the Seven Republics of New Burgundy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145053.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS54.D;The new nation differed from most other nations. Taking the model of the New Hanseatic League, the state of New Burgundy was divided into seven confederal Republics as per the name, each ruled by a Grand Pensionary, who would serve as its governor, and serves a subsidiary role to the Stadtholder (Stathouder in French), who would be responsible for the policies affecting all states as well as New Burgundy’s foreign policies. Debates ensued to decide of the name of the new state. The hero of the Independence War and first Stadhoudter coined the term of Belgian Confederacy, taking the name after the antic area from where a lot of the colonists came.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145054.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS55.D;Originally ruled under the National Liberals (Parti National Libéral), power shifted to the more jingoistic Moderate Party (Parti Modéré). It was Stadtholder Damien Collet who gave rise to the popular idea of Arcadianism, the idea that all of Arcadia should be united under one government “Par la Raison ou la Force!” (By Reason or By Force!). These jingoistic attitudes led to Vinalnd (who gained independence in 1808) and Plantagenia (who gained independence in 1771) to declare war on the Confederacy.The War of the Double Alliance (1819-1821) was a long and drawn out conflict, that would see war heroes like Jacques Lahure (nicknamed “the Hannibal of the West”) and Willem Le Cocq fight glorious battles against their Vinlandic and Plantagenian rivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145055.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS56.D;Septiman military dominance, confirmed by the industrialization of New Burgundy over its rivals to the North and south, ensured that the Treaty of Erikshavn was in their favor, securing Basse-Leonie and various border provinces along the Plantagenian and Vinlandic borders would be in their hands.  However it also brought about a completely new vice, the concept of Slavery, which, despite being restricted to its southernmost Republics, began the debate over the legality of slavery, especially through its claims into slaveholding Plantagenia. The Seven Republics emerged as the most industrialized power in Arcadia, and with it the ideals of Arcadianism could very well be within their grasp...?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145056.A;I knew Belgium wasn't a real country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS60.T;History of Scandinavia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS60.D;The Legacy of the Nordic Crowns stem from the personal union of Margaret, Queen and Regent of Denmark and through her son Olaf (who passed in 1387) and victory over the Swedish Magnates, ruler of Norway and Sweden. Thus she became known as the Mother of Scandinavia, beloved by her people. Such successes however would not be shared by her immediate successors. Eric of Pomerania continuously incited conflicts against Schleswig, Holstein, Mecklenburg, and even against various Pomeranian Principalities in his attempt to unite all these lands. This sentiment was not shared by the Swedes, who often traded with these various duchies. In addition, Danish centralization was something not supported by the Swedish Riksdag, including the imposition of the Sound Dues to increase income at the expense of the Hanseatic League, which led to the Danish-Hanseatic War (1426-1435). However he was also credited with the foundation of Copenhagen as the capital for Denmark, and ultimately of the Kalmar Union itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145060.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS61.D;It was not to last however, revolts across Scandinavia broke out, in Sweden by the farmers, and later the nobility against his practices, forcing him to yield to Holstein and the Hansa, in Norway a peasant revolt broke out and successfully took Oslo, finally, in Denmark, the Danish magnates refusal to crown Bogislaw IX, the Duke of Pomerania as Eric’s heir caused the King to retreat to Visborg in Gotland, which would later lead to his abdication by all three kingdoms. He would be succeeded by his nephew, Christopher of Bavaria, who put down many of the rebellions in Denmark. Unfortunately he proved to be an ineffective ruler, unable to challenge Eric of Pomerania’s piracy, as well as gain acceptance in Sweden, so much so, and also out of a desire to regain independence, chose its own King, Charles VIII rather than go with Christian I upon Christopher III’s death in 1448.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145061.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS62.D;Christian I and Charles VIII initiated a rivalry over the Norwegian throne, ultimately leading to a war which later historians would call the Scandinavian Civil War (1451-1465). Charles VIII successfully resisted all forces sent to depose him, led by the Oxenstierna and Vasa families, and ruled with power shared by the Riksdag until his death in 1470. But Christians troubles did not subside upon becoming King of Sweden, having to deal with various parts of his realm trying to govern themselves locally. Christian was credited with the founding of the University of Copenhagen in 1478. Another credit was the peace made between the Kalmar Union and Scotland, with the betrothal and later marriage of Margaret of Denmark, the daughter of Christopher of Bavaria to James III of Scotland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145062.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS63.D;His successor, John I, was the first monarch to balance the interests of the powers involved, attempting to weaken the power of Swedish magnate Sten Sturre and of the Hansa through the support of Novgorod, something which was arranged to best protect them against the forces of the Muscovites under Ivan III. (The Novgorod-Muscovite War of 1496, 1496-1499). The first permanent Danish, later Scandinavian Navy would be founded under his rule, while a brief war with the Swedes (1497) led to Sturre being forced to surrender to John I, and the subsequent creation of the title, Kings of the North. Unfortunately, in an attempt to conquer Dithmarshen in the Battle of Hemmingstedt (17 February 1500), the Dithmarsians trapped John, his son and crown prince Christian, and the mercenaries in a flooded dyke, drowning all involved, opening Scandinavia to the reality of being torn asunder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145063.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS64.D;It would be later that year that Danish magnates, as well as various Norwegian magnates came to bring a relative of John I, his nephew, King James IV of Scotland to become King of the North, a title he would assume as Jacob I. Jacob was the typical renaissance prince, sponsoring Scandinavia’s first printing press, establishing gun foundries in Copenhagen as well as his old home in Edinburgh, and brought renaissance art and science to the Scandinavian nation. He was also responsible for finally subjugating the Swedish rebels under Gustav Vasa (who attempted to crown himself Gustav I). In true renaissance fashion, James IV being the polygot that he was, carried out a reform of the Danish language, utilizing rules and stipulations from the nascent Norwegian and Swedish languages in order to streamline administration throughout Scandinavia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145064.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS65.D;Military reforms were also carried out as well, establishing a united Kalmar Army, which would be put to use in supporting Novgorod in conflicts with Muscovy, as well as bringing Pskov into the fold when anti-Kalmari Novgoroders gained power in the Merchant republic, bringing about the Livonian War (1558-1585) as Scandinavia fought Novgorod & Poland-Lithuania for control over the remnant Livonian Order (later secularized into the Duchy of Courland-Semigalia.His son, James II, and his successor, James III, would be responsible for the establishment of Protestantism in Scandinavia, James II, upon his coronation charter on 7 August 1523, he was made the protector of the Catholic Church of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, and in that role he took an opprotunistic approach in weakening the power of Catholic nobles and clergy. But James III was more overt in his views of Protestantism, having been one of the royals to attend the Diet of Worms and was influenced by the doctrines of Huldrych Zwingli.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145065.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS66.D;On 30 October 1536, he formally established the Scandinavian Zwinglian Church as the national church of Scandinavia, following the example of the Burgundian monarchs. A brief war with the Holy Roman Empire (1542-1544) prevented the restoration of Catholicism in Scandinavia in support of James III’s brother, Matthew.John III would later be credited with the sponsoring of the first explorations of Scandinavia into the New World, shortly after Burgundy did the same some years earlier. Through his expeditions he would see about the creation of Colonial Vinland, though it would be his son and successor, Eric VIII who would continue and expand such funding, establishing more cities along the Vinlandic coast and even made expeditions into the Caribbean, successfully snatching away the Anglo-French colony of Galatia in what would eventually become Sudurhafeyjar.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145066.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS67.D;His successors would also be responsible for its colonial policies in East Asia, gaining access, along with Burgundy, over the Malaccan spice trade, carving out a niche of outposts and colonies in India, the Tondolese Kingdom (later renamed Christiania after Christian II, who was monarch at the time of the colonial acquisition of the Christianian Islands). In addition, outposts and colonies were established in Africa as well, holding control over Mocambike between Zanzibar and Burgundian South Africa, overall, Scandinavia became the second largest colonial power in the Eastern Hemisphere, behind that of the Burgundians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145067.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS68.D;Eric VIII would also be responsible for the restarting of the Scandinavian-Bohemian rivalry over the religious affairs of Germany, as well as the Scandinavian desire for Dominium Maris Baltici (Baltic Sea Dominion), the desire for all of the Baltic Sea to eventually become a Scandinavian lake. Despite Eric’s failure for a dominant role in Northern Germany he was able to acquire Pomerania, and directly threaten Jagiellon Poland-Lithuania, the final key to true dominance in the Baltic. However such plans would be laid to waste over the following decades, as Pomerania and Prussia became a battleground, all the while keeping Russia divided in order to ensure its ascendency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145068.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS69.D;This became crucial in the Great German War where Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus V, directly threatened the interests of Scandinavia and its ally Burgundy by threatening to unite and centralize the Holy Roman Empire. Despite the martial nature of Scandinavia, the Lion of Europe scored key victories, even retaking Pomerania from the Scandinavians, and even directly threatening to bring Denmark into the fold. But the various Protestant Princes, not wanting to be destroyed by the major Catholic power brought their resources to bear, and under the leadership of Burgundy and Scandinavia, was able to force Wenceslaus to the negotiating table.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

SS70.T;History of Beornia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS70.D;Following the French Wars of Succession, the Kingdom of England emerged as the greatest power in Europe during the early modern era. But that did not mean that the English citizens became members of the ruling class. With the majority of the post-Norman English nobility being Francophone, it was not long before further alienation of the upper class from the ordinary Englishmen and the moving of the court of the Dual Thrones to the mainland with England becoming once again just a province of a Romance realm.While portions of the English population, especially in the more populated cities in the South, embraced the French supremacy willingly, abandoning their Germanic roots in the process, the inhabitants of northern England did not give up so easily. As it usually happens in large heterogeneous realms, those on the outskirts felt neglected and discriminated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145070.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS71.D;As such, the North developed quite a grudge against the Plantagenet monarchy, fuelled by Scandinavians who became united with the Scottish Crown in the early 16th century. Hoping to sow a seed of discontent in the Anglo-French dominion, Scandinavians spread the idea of a Church free from Rome and, by extension, from Paris. The notion of Protestantism was seen by local political elites as a powerful means to gain a degree of autonomy and was wholeheartedly accepted by the common folk who felt detached from the incomprehensible world of Latin liturgy. And thus, the Reformed Anglican Church was born.The Dual Monarchy was initially tolerant to the various branches of Protestantism spreading throughout her realm. Fearing a possible rebellion in England which would most definitely prove costly and difficult for the Court in Paris while having his eyes firmly set on the affairs on the mainland, Édouard V issued the Edict of Cantorbéry in 1553, legalising the Reformed Church.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145071.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS72.D;This document also granted the English nobility a large degree of freedom in their local matters - together with the Irish autonomy, the beginning of the second half of the 16th century saw a major decline of Plantagenet control over the Isles, even though the English Parliament was officially abolished by Édouard's father in 1537. This changed quickly, though. The Irish independence was systematically destroyed during the three Irish Wars and at the dawn of the 17th century the line of appeasement kings ended with François I who aggressively challenged the breakup of the religious unity and stood firm against Burgundy, the champion of the Protestant faith. The Catholic forces eventually emerged victorious in the Anglo-French Wars of Religion, both externally and internally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145072.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS73.D;Securing the outer border, François decided to finish the 'Insular Problem' once and for all and while he deployed forces in the Nine Years' War against the Irish, he also abolished the Edict of Canterbéry and began a massive re-catholisation of the English lands. While the nobles, often fearing the loss of their holdings mostly surrendered to the Catholic king, the lower classes did not share the same sentiment. With the lands of Ameriga being gradually discovered by Anglo-French and Burgundian navigators, the desperate Anglicans saw them as the new Promised Land where they shall be granted freedom and independence. And so, similarly to the French Huguenots, large groups of Englishmen refusing to accept the Catholic faith fled to the harbours in the Lowlands from which they set sail towards the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145073.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS74.D;Seeking escape from the French domination, the Father Pilgrims (as they will be later named) arrived after facing the difficulties of the Trans-Atlantic voyage at the coast of Neo Anglia, a land even deeper in the south than the Burgundian colony of Nouvelle Amsterdam. Neo Anglia was unofficially claimed by England-France which even established several settlements there, especially near the Riviere de l’Argent. But the Dual Monarchy's zones of interest were wide and so the Court of Paris had to abandon some of its endeavours every now and then. Seeing that Neo Anglia was subject of the influx of Anglican settlers supported by the Burgundians, the Plantagenet administration quickly decided to abandon this potential powder keg which would most probably simply drain the valuable resources of the realm and relocated its focus elsewhere. And so the Kingdom of England-in-exile slowly started to emerge, first independent settler state in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145074.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS75.D;The Anglicans, obviously carrying much hatred against Romance languages in general, swiftly started changing remaining Anglo-French names to more suitable ones. Being a mixture of English patriots and fierce Anglicans, the land was designated accordingly - hence you can now visit Seaxburgh and New Jerusalem, Eoferwic and Æthelwulf, all in one country. So in the 1630s, the English settlements started quickly developing with more and more people arriving from Albion, hearing news about the Eden on Earth. A desire for unity began to grow and in 1657 the representatives of important communes arrived at the place where it all began, at the isthmus of the Silver River, eager to build a united country. Fierciely believing in the concept of royal majesty and overall bound by the 17th century mentality, they decided to establish a Kingdom, maintaining the English Crown in exile in South Ameriga.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145075.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS76.D;With almost no important nobles being among them, John Cavendish, being a renegade son of the Duke of Newcastle and one of the ship captains who led the first Father Pilgrims in the 1620s was chosen to be the new realm's leader. Cavendish, being industrious and having already scouted the land before during his services as a Burgundian privateer saw the opportunity of carving a power base for himself in the New World and settled soon in the lands of Avalon (the formerly occupied Neo Anglia) and further sponsored the efforts of Anglicans to bring more fellow countrymen to Ameriga. As such, he became a well-known and respected member of the society during the first half of the 17th century. And so John Cavendish, being well in his sixties, became the first King of the new Kingdom in 1658, stylising himself as Edward I. The nation's capital was founded at the Silver River which proved to be an important source of wealth for the Anglicans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145076.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS77.D;In tradition of mixing Anglo-Saxon, Anglican and Briton heritage, the city was named Camelot and the Kingdom changed from England-in-exile to Beornicia honouring old Anglo-Saxon settlers with the name soon corrupted to Beornia by popular use. John Cavendish, now Edward I, thus founded the House of Beornia, essentially claiming the Crown of England. But truth be told, no one really cared. Beornia was distant and sparselypopulated and after the initial Anglican influx, the flow of immigrants almost stopped. Devout to Puritanism, with a weird language and even weirder customs, New England quickly isolated itself from the outside world, only dealing with the Burgundian governors from time to time. But even despite that the Kingdom grew. Expanding as far as the Lake Ginosar and even beyond, the Beornian colonists soon came to contact with the Incas in the late 17th century. The massives of Andes proved to be a solid border and no real conflict with the Empire emerged.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145077.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS78.D;The 18th century was quite peaceful throughout the Beornian lands, aside of some petty feudal squabbles and battles with natives. The only event worth mentioning was the short-lived war of succession when Henry, the Duke of Godwinson, rose against his infant cousin Harold and the appointed regent Sir Peter Bryne in 1757, seizing Camelot in 1758 only to be ousted by loyalists during the same year, defeated in 1760 and executed the same year. His estates were then appropriated by Sir Bryne who became the new Duke of Godwinson. Eventually, the 19th century and the modern era creeped in, even in Ameriga. The citizens of European colonies started to doubt the oversea governance and one after another started anti-European actions. In 1805, the Burgundian colony of Lotharingia began her own quest for independence and Beornians were quite keen on helping. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145078.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS79.D;Arthur III of Beornia, being one of the more enlightened Kings who had his children educated in Europe, believed in the ideals of freedom and hoped that the Lotharians would become another free New World country. He even attended the ceremony in Charlemagne officially celebrating the birth of the Lotharian Republic. Talks over the end of the firm feudal regime and birth of a Beornian constitution ended abruptly, though, in 1817 when Edward IV became King, returning from Europe enchanted by the notion of Bohemian absolutism. Camelot's alliance with Lotharingia held, despite that, more specifically the alliance with the authoritarian elements, especially the would-be dictator De Aigle. With Beornian help, De Aigle was in spite of several major setbacks able to restore order in the newborn republic which was in the middle of a downward spiral. He was a person to Edward's liking, even marrying his niece in 1827, the King dreaming to spread the true English nobility throughout the new post-colonial states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145079.A;Anyway Tapt O are Beornian!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS80.T;History of Aragon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS80.D;The Crown of Aragon’s genesis came from the personal union of Queen Petronilla, Queen of Aragon and one of the last of the Jimena Dynasty, to the Count of Barcelona, Raymond Berengar IV in 1162. Since then, the Aragonese crown grew under successive monarchs, all while maintaining the composite monarchical structure with the incorporation of Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and finally Sicily, achieved with the death of King Martin of Sicily, son of King Martin I of Aragon in 1409. However such victory was short lived with the former’s death the following year, throwing the Aragonese monarchy into chaos for the next two years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145080.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS81.D;Ferran’s son and successor, Alfons V oversaw the reunification, if only temporary, of the full Kingdom of Sicily, in 1442 in the Neapolitan War of Succession (1432-1442), and successfully vassalized the Principality of Albania as it was fighting a war with the Ottoman Empire. Alfons believed himself the inheritor of the destiny of Charles d’Anjou, to re-create the Latin Empire of Constantinople, a Maritime Empire stretching from Aragon to Greece. Alfons’ dream, as it became known by successive Aragonese Kings, would be passed down through each monarch since him. After Alfons’ death, the thrones were split, Aragon going to his younger brother John II, while Naples passed to Alfons’ illegitimate son Ferrante.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145081.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS82.D;John II, who also served as de facto King of Navarre, spent his reign trying to incorporate Navarre into the Aragonese domain, a conflict that would dominate Aragonese foreign policy during the reigns of his successors Ferdinand II and John III. The Navarrese who opposed him, led first by his eldest son Charles IV, Prince of Viana, and later his daughter Blanche II, led to a sharp rebuke, even among the Aragonese, who’s support for the Prince of Viana ultimately led to the Catalonian Civil War (1462-1472), which saw various claimants, first Charles IV, then later to Enrique IV of Castile, and later Pedro, Constable of Portugal and Rene, Duke of Anjou and Count of Provence. All times John rose to the occassion, and although he lost influence over Navarre, John was able to secure his monarchy for himself and his chosen heir Ferdinand II.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145082.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS83.D;Under Ferdinand II, Aragon continued in its battle for the Navarrese, first by supporting the Agramont-backed candidate John de Foix or the throne (even going as far as marrying John’s youngest sister Leonor de Foix), then later after John’s death, utilizing Leonor’s claim to try and bring Navarre into the crown. However this action provoked the newly established Dual Monarchy, provoking the First Navarrese War (1512-1516). This conflict, which saw the Navarrese Kingdom divided between two halves saw the Anglo-French annexation of the Counties of Foix & Bearn on the Northern half of the Pyrenees, while Navarre became a satellite state of the Aragonese Crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145083.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS84.D;Another achievement made by Ferdinand II was his actions towards the Barbary Pirates. During his reign, Ferdinand expanded the Naval Shipyards at Valencia and Barcelona and built fleets of ships to counter the Barbary Pirates, but he did more than this, after Barbary raids at Palma in the Balearic Islands and in Sardinia, Ferdinand decided to move against one of the Barbary bases, namely Oran and Algiers, held by the Zayyanid Kingdom of Tlemcen. The Aragonese-Algierian War (1500-1512) was the first major conflict Aragon launched against an African power, and the first major conflict since the end of the Reconquista in 1492 (the Spanish conquest of Melilla in 1497 notwithstanding) The twelve year long conflict saw the entirety of the Algerian Coast gained for Aragon, the single largest takeover of Muslim land since Ferdinand III’s conquest of much of Spain. The final expansion of Aragonese North Africa would not be made complete until the Conquest of Tunis, now Carthage, by John III in 1535.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145084.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS85.D;John III, known as the “Constable” was known for instituting major reforms to his new domains. Among his reforms, he Chartered Merchant Companies, aimed towards breaking the power of the many Italian Trading families, and reducing internal competition. Workhouses were built for orphans of fallen soldiers, allowing them greater access to careers towards the state and military. But one of the greatest reforms was the centralization of the varying disparate Cortes, bringing together the Parliamentary bodies of Aragon (Zaragoza), Catalonia (Barcelona), Valencia (Valencia), Sardinia (Cagliari) & Sicily (Palermo) into one united Cortes General. Naples would be added to this domain in 1550 with the death of Ferrante III of Naples, thus restoring the patrimony of Alfons V.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145085.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS86.D;John III was no slouch in the affairs of diplomacy and war either, as evidenced in the War of the League of Naples (1519-1526). The conflict, pitting the Valois Coalition of Provence, Genoa, Tuscany & Ferrara against the Aragonese-led League of Naples (Aragon, Naples, Papal States, Milan & Modena) saw back and force conflict up and down the peninsula. Ultimately culminating in a Neapolitan League Victory at Bologna in 1525, thus removing all Valois Influence from Italy. Much of Aragon’s succeeding monarchs spent their time dealing with the Threat of the Ottoman Empire, who backed the surviving Barbary Pirates from their bases in the Hafsid Kingdom (or at times against the Ottoman Navy itself from the Balkans) or dealing with tensions against the Trastamaras of Spain or the Plantagenets of Anglo-France. In addition, the Aragonese, especially after the gaining of Naples, cultivated their influence in Italy and Venice in preparation of their Imperial Ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145086.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS87.D;Thus it was all the more surprising when the Tuscans killed the Provencal Viceroy in Florence and declared the Etrurian Republic. The threat of a revolutionary republic in Italy was too great for Aragon, especially when it spread its influence across the peninsula by warfare (1807-1814), even directly taking control of much of Naples and threatening their other Italian possessions before finally being overturned. Disaster continued to plague Aragon, as a weakening economy, further support in its foreign policy goals (supporting the Venetian reconquest of the Peloponnese and Attica, and supporting and even supplying an illegitimate son of John IV to the Macedonian throne) and a King who was unable to sire an heir led to a crisis over succession. Enter Josep Serna.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145087.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS88.D;Serna was another illegitimate child of the womanizing King John IV, and like his half-brother, the King of Macedon, was legitimized according to the King’s will when John died in 1799. Josep had a storied career as a military officer who took part in many battles against the Djezairid Sultanate of Algeria and during the Italian Revolutionary War. When Alfons VI died in September 1835, the Aragonese Succession Crisis began. The original heir, Ferran VI was crowned later that month, but died within 44 days of his reign, with the throne left to his daughter, Maria. Maria was known for her luxury taste, frivolous spending and a notorious streak of having many lovers. Josep, with the support of the people across the realm went to Barcelona with his fellow soldiers. The Aragonese Parliament, not wanting to go against the will of the people, summoned Josep to the Parliament where he was crowned as King.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145088.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS89.D;Thus the House of Serna was born as a Royal Family, to continue the legacy of Alfons V. For the Aragonese desire to create a Mediterranean Lake, a dream shared by the Romans and the Latin Empire of which they claim descent. With the rapidly declining Ottomans and with Italy in their pocket, their dream of such an empire may very well come soon.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145089.A;Aragon will make into Gonder this time maybe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS90.T;History of the Incan Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS90.D;The Origins of the Empire of Tawantinsuyu (Quecha for the Four Regions), known among Europeans as the Inca Empire, started with the rise of the Kingdom of Cusco. Pachacuti, transformed his Kingdom to an Empire with the conquest of the Chanca, and the incorporation of various Andean Kingdoms into this new Empire. Unlike the other preeminent power of the New World, the Aztec Triple Alliance, the Inca would achieve its expansion through diplomacy and intrigue, scouting out prospective kingdoms in terms of political organization, military strength and wealth, and sending messengers convincing leaders the benefits of joining the Empire. Once these Kingdoms were peacefully integrated, the ruler’s children would be sent to Cusco to be taught in Quecha and in Incan administrative systems. Inter-marriages between the Cuscan elite and these children helped further integrate these Kingdoms into the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145090.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS91.D;The only serious military campaigns prior to contact with the Chinese, were against their chief rival, the Kingdom of Chimor (also known as Chimu) and against the Mapuche (1470-1493). The former would be subjugated in 1470, while the latter would prove resilient to Inca invasion.During the late 15th century, the Inca would be greeted by traders hailing from Dong Guo City-State of Yongle. This first contact proved very beneficial for the Incans, as it introduced to them horses, gunpoweder weaponry and more importantly, advisors that helped to reform the Incan administrative system, derived from a combination of Incan and Chinese models. This centralized structure helped the Incans in the trials ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145091.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS92.D;The death of Huayna Capac I and his son and heir Ninan Cuyochi in 1527 would leave the Inca in turmoil as his two youngest sons, Huáscar and Atahualpa would come to blows against each other in the Inca Civil War (1529-1532) after the former arrested and killed the latter’s supporters. Huáscar would take the reigns, supported by the aristocracy and the religious authorities. However his control was restricted to the southern parts of the Empire, while Atahualpa was well supported by the Northern Aristocrats for his more liberal views of thinking. However he was also supported by the Yongle traders, and with his large reserve of gold and silver, he was able to buy the services of some 500 Dongese soldiers to serve him. Despite being few in number, their weaponry, professionalism and thick armor proved to be one of the deciding factors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145092.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS93.D;The other factor was disease, spread by the recent Spanish colonization and exploration of Mesoamerica, these diseases were ravaging the Incan Empire, this was recognized by Atahualpa, who through the Dongese merchants, procured of the knowledge of variolation, a preventative measure used in China for several centuries. These combined factors, and Atahualpa’s ability to reform and solve these problems, helped to change the tide, defeating and killing Huáscar, and winning the war. The Dongese soldiers that served him would go on to become the Chinu Guard, Chinu being the Quecha word for Chinese).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145093.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS94.D;Atahualpa set off for Cusco to be crowned as Sapa Inca, however along the way his party was ambushed by the Spanish expedition led by Francisco Pizarro. Many of the Incan troops were killed, and the survivors - several Yongle soldiers among them - were taken hostage. Atahualpa arranged to pay the Spaniards an exorbitant amount of gold and silver for his release. However, when the payment was made, the Spanish simply took it and kept their prisoners. They intended to depose of Atahualpa and Francisco would be proclaimed the new Sapa Inca. News of the deception spread, enraging Atahualpa’s generals as well as the Chinu Guard. Quizquiz, an Incan general, gathered the remains of the Incan army, and together with new soldiers hired from the Dongese City-States, marched to expel the Spanish and free their emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145094.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS95.D;The Spanish, whose original expedition was quite small (just 168 men, 27 horses, and a single cannon), had nonetheless gathered an army from various populations that wanted to see an end to Incan rule. They expected to crush the ‘savages’ easily. Although the Chinese technology was not at the same level as the European military, it was enough to rout the indigenous army loyal to the conquistador, and the elite Spanish troops were overwhelmed by numbers. Pizarro planned to threaten to kill Atahualpa to force Quizquiz to surrender; however, he was betrayed and killed by his associate, Diego de Almagro. Almagro organized the Spanish surrender. The captive Emperor and his guard were released, in exchange for allowing the remaining Spaniards to leave. After their defeat in Tawantinsuyu, Spain sent more troops to reinforce their holdings in the New World. They made reparations to the newly crowned Sapa Inca and negotiated a treaty that would allow Spanish settlers into the northern areas of the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;
145095.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS96.D;Historians argue over why Atahualpa accepted the treaty. Some believe that due to mistranslation, or even deliberate deception on the part of the Spanish, that the emperor thought the Spanish were actually submitting to him and asking to join his empire. Others say that Atahualpa knew he could not defeat the true Spanish army, and that he made concessions to prevent the conquest of his empire. The latter would prove true when the Spanish launched a second invasion in 1572 (lasting to 1576), shortly after the accession of Paullu as Sapa Inca, which saw the Incan court moved from Cusco to Chuquisaca, which would serve as the Court of the Inca to the modern day. It would not be until the end of the century that the Inca would find another protector, the Dual Monarchy of England and France. Although the Plantagenets failed in converting the Quecha people to Catholicism, they were able to gain a tributary state, exchanging gold and silver from the mines of Potosi for the continued foreign protection from Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145096.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS97.D;The beginning of the Westernization of the Incan Empire began mid-way into the reign of Túpac Amaru II, utilizing traders and support from not only their traditional friends, the Dongese City States (later the Qingqiu Federation) but also from their protectors the Dual Monarchy of England and France. The progress would be slow, as attempts at reform met with sharp reaction by the conservative elite. The utilization of foreign-born officers, weapons and schooling had been some of the steps implemented by during the years of Túpac Amaru prior to his death. These reforms would be slowed down during the reign of his successors Huáscar III and Huayna Capac IV, yet continued in an attempt to keep their independence possible. The Incan Administration began to be reformed under the European (specifically Anglo-French model), while Financal reform saw the tradition Incan currency being replaced with paper currency, the Liwru (a Quechua term for Livre).;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145097.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS98.D;During the Spanish-American Wars of Independence, Spain, desperate to put an end to the rebellious Columbian Alliance, asked for an alliance with the Inca in 1828, offering them the Captaincy-Generals of Aqequipa & Quito in exchange for military support. Seeing this as an opportunity to test the combat capability of the new westernized Incan Army, Huayna Capac IV accepted. The Incan Intervention (1828-1832) saw the Incans achieve military success during the early parts of the conflict, reconquering their former capital, Cusco and bringing the Catholicized Quecha to the fold throughout the Central Andes, proceeding to advance towards the titular capital of the Captaincy-General of Quito. This would culminate in the Battle of Lima in July 1830. The Battle was was one that could have gone either way, as it saw the Colombian leader Simón Bolivar killed in the battle. However, it was the Columbians who won the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145098.A;Interesting ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS99.D;and after two years of little successes and great drawbacks, Huayna Capac IV sued for peace, paying reparations, and relinquishing their hold on Arequipa & Quito. The defeat inflicted upon the Inca convinced the Sapa Inca and many in the leadership that further reforms would be needed, but with Huayna Capac growing old and soon to be dying, the task would soon fall to his son, the Prince-Apparent, Usco. Usco, who wishes to become as great as the great founder of Tawantinsuyu, Pachacuti, wishes to take on the mantle of dragging the Empire into the 19th century, but can he succeed, with hostile Europeans surrounding this great nation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145099.A;Time for us to get back the Andes I guess ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS100.T;History of Provence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS100.D;The French Wars of Succession was nothing short of a disaster for the Valois dynasty. The combination of unlucky factors, such as the death of Jeanne d’Arc in 1431, the Burgundians remaining with the Plantagenets with the Treaty of Arras in 1435 and the disastrous defeat at Vichy in 1471 helped contribute to the total annihilation of the Armagnac party. Reduced to its holdings in Languedoc, Auvergne (ruled by the powerful House of La Tour d’Auvergne since 1437) and Provence (inherited from Charles III upon the latter's death in 1481), Charles VIII was forced to sign the Treaty of Rome in 1498, confirming his current domains and the title of “King in France” and Duke of Provence (as Charles IV) in exchange for recognizing the Plantagenets as Kings of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145100.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS101.D;The next significant development in the history the Valois was their Italian policy, which began in 1494 with the marriage of Charles IV to Contessina Beatrice de Medici, a daughter of the last Gonfaloniere and first Duke of Florence, Lorenzo I de Medici. Over the course of the reign of Charles IV and his successor François I, they would conduct an effective marriage policy featuring members of the extended Valois family to notable Italian families. Their connections helping to spread the Renaissance culture and style to Provence, as well as helping to contribute Italian words,mixed with the French and local Occitan to what would become the Provençal Language.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145101.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS102.D;Unfortunately, this marriage policy would only garner an enemy in the form of the pro-Papal Guleph faction, the pro-Imperial Ghibelline faction, and the Aragonese, who had their own designs of controlling Italy. This would ultimately culminate in the War of the League of Naples (1519-1526) fought between the Valois Coalition (Provence, Genoa, Tuscany & Ferrara) and the titular League of Naples (Aragon, the Papal States, Milan, Modena and Naples). The war culminated in the League’s decisive victory in the Battle of Bologna in 1525, which saw the capture of François I, and the signing of the Treaty of Barcelona, which saw Provence’s Italian holdings (predominantly that of Reggio and Ferrara, with which was held in Personal Union) lost to the various members of the League and the expulsion of Provençal notables from the Peninsula in exchange for his release.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145102.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS103.D;Provence’s luck further deteriorated when François, supporting in hiding Huldrych Zwingli in Aix-en-Provence led to the First Provençal War (1522-1525) which saw the Anglo-French annexation of Auvergne (after the mysterious death of the last Duchess of Auvergne, Anne de La Tour d’Auvergne). Open support for Protestantism, as well as François’ continued interference in Italy had led to his excommunication by Pope Adrian VI and a call for Crusade against them. It would be the Avignon Massacre, the slaughter of all clergymen during François’ conquest of that Papal holding that brought both Bohemia and the Dual Monarchy to invade in the Languedoc War of 1532, the second wanting to ensure his title of King of France went undisputed. Burgundian & Aragonese support against the two helped to bring together the Treaty of Nice. François was removed from the Provençal throne, and would be replaced by his nephew, Philip II/VIII. At the same time, the Dual Monarchy would annex the Languedoc region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145103.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS104.D;Protestantism would rear it’s head again during the War of the Provençal Succession (1568-1576) which pitted the Catholic and pro-Anglo-French Duke Charles V/IX against his cousin, the pro-Burgundian and Protestant Louis, Count of Venaissin (styled Louis V/XI). It was around during the war that Aix-en-Provence, the traditional seat of the Dukes of Provence were captured by Protestant forces in 1572, on the Feast Day of Saint Bartholomew. As a result, Charles was forced to move his court to Toulon which would become the Provençal capital to this day. Ultimately, the Count of Venaissin was captured and exiled to Burgundy, and Charles would be confirmed as Duke of Provence. Though it would not be until the Treaty of Saint Denis in 1584 that officially ended formal support for Provençal Protestants.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145104.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS105.D;Philip III/IX, his successor would prove the ultimate irony however in proclaiming the Edict of Avignon in 1616, which solved the issue of religion by making Catholicism and Protestantism legal throughout the Duchy, the first such nation in Europe that provided freedom of religion for Christians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145105.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS106.D;The events of the second half of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century would see Provence falling into the influence of Aragon. On the other hand, the newly found religious tolerance combined with the Aragonese desire to eliminate all remaining Imperial and Anglo-French influence on the Apennine Peninsula allowed Provençal rulers to normalise their relations with the Italian rulers and consequently to resurrect their Italian ambitions, though now mostly under the baton of Barcelona. The Valois diplomatic efforts would finally come to fruition in 1708, when Louis V/XI of France would marry his only child, Anne, to Giovanni Battista Gastone de Medici, the heir to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. When Louis died in 1710, Giovanni ascended to the Tuscan throne as Jean I/III of Valois-Medici. His inheriting of the Grand Duchy in 1723 would mark the true beginning of the Tuscan-Provençal personal union and an age of prosperity for the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145106.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS107.D;During the Great German War (1795-1820), Provence would be one of the major combatants in the conflict against the revolutionary Republic of Etruria, who through revolution terminated the personal union in favor of a republic. Although they were successful in helping to contain the Republic to Tuscany, they were unable to restore the personal union. With the dawn of the post-Wenceslausian era, the Valois of Provence are now divided on their intentions. Do they continue the fight against the Plantagenets to reclaim their birthright? Or do they go against their masters and seek to unite the Italian Peninsula as successors to the legacy of Charles d’Anjou and Lorenzo de’ Medici. For Provence, despite a long string of bad luck, perhaps they may still rise again.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145107.A;Pour le vrai Roy de France!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS120.T;History of Plantagenia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS120.D;Anglo-French colonization of the New World began shortly after its discovery and the founding of Fort St. Francis in 1490 in what is now the Province of Leonie. The Treaty of Pamplona, signed three years later would confirm that lands North of the Cape Verde Islands would belong to them, a fact that was flagrantly violated by not only the Spanish, but also the Burgundians and Scandinavians. Despite this, fact, the colonization of the Southeastern Arcadian mainland proceeded smoothly, with the founding of other outposts, including Talahasi in modern Alibamon province (a French corruption of the original Seminole name, Talahassee) in 1538, and the founding of Nouvelle Orléans in modern Nouvelle France Province. (named after then Duke of Orléans, Francis de Plantagenêt) in 1545.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145120.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS121.D;Unlike the Spaniards, who incorporated the Aztec and other tribal ruling classes into the colonial elite, the Anglo-French elite were predominantly those who immigrated from the mainland. Many of the Native Arcadian populace, such as the Seminole, Creek, Chickasaw and Shawnee tribes. Only the Cherokee remained largely resistant to Assimilation, fiercely maintaining their culture, despite being incorporated into colonial rule in the mid 18th century.(the Cherokee language would not see significant reform until 1821 under Sequoyah.);;;;;;;;;;;;;
145121.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS122.D;The Anglo-French colonist also saw significant challenges from rival colonial powers. Despite the traditional Anglo-Franco-Spanish alliance, there were border incidents between the Crown Colony of Plantagenia (as their Arcadian colony was known) and the Viceroyalty of New Spain (and later Viceroyalty of Lusitania) that put a strain on their relationship. This also showed in the hostile relationships with New Burgundy and Vinland, and the various wars fought in the mainland reverberated in the colonies as well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145122.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS123.D;The road to Plantagenia’s independence from the Dual Monarchy was in a sense, unintentional. It began with the death of King Édouard VI and the subsequent self-exile of Prince Charles to Nouvelle Orléans, where he would serve as the de facto Viceroy of the colony. During his stay there, he reformed the colonial army, transforming it from a series of separate militias into a professional fighting force. It was these reforms that made Charles secure enough to proclaim himself the rightful King of England and France, triggering the Anglo-French War of Succession (1767-1771);;;;;;;;;;;;;
145123.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS124.D;The Plantagenian Army challenged the Dual Monarchy to battle, and because of their superior knowledge in terrain, the use of militia to serve as skirmishers, the support of Scandinavia to supply arms and ships, and the half-hearted support of the Conservatives in power, saw the systematic conquest of Plantagenia for Charles by 1770. However, despite a successful landing in Brittany, the Army of King Charles was decisively defeated in the Battle of Rennes, subsequent battles saw any possibility of maintaining their hold in Brittany unfeasible, and because of the Dual Monarchy’s inability to regain their former colony, both sides agreed to peace. The Treaty of Brest confirmed Henri IX as King of England and France, and Prince Charles as King of Plantagenia as King Charles I, with both sides relinquishing claims on the others’ throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145124.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS125.D;Plantagenia enjoyed a great period of peace since independence, maintaining its culture and its rights (slavery still being legal and widespread throughout all parts of the Kingdom), however the threat of Arcadianism espoused by the Seven Republics of New Burgundy was both a curse, in form of its disastrous defeat by their hand in the War of the Double Alliance, and a blessing, as these ideas gave rise to the concept of Plantagenia, not the Seven Republics, being the one to lead a united Arcadia to a brighter future. And so, Plantagenia, convinced of its new destiny, marches forth in the name of enlightenment and King.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145125.A;An Arcadian Empire seems like a good idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS130.T;History of Vinland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS130.D;Scandinavian tradition of colonization can be traced back as early as the Viking Age. Norwegian settlers for the most part sailed West, discovering Faroe Islands and colonizing them. Then it was the turn of Iceland from where Erik the Red, whose father was exiled from Norway and who himself was banned from Iceland, sailed to Greenland. His son Leif would then become the first European to reach Arcadia, calling the land where he landed “Vinland”, “land of the grapes” for savage grapes were found in this place. The Norse settlement was however abandoned after encroachments with the “Skraelings”, the name given to the indigenous population. For 5 centuries, Vinland was abandoned and forgotten while Greenland soon became isolated from Iceland and thus Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145130.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS131.D;However, to avoid losing in the course for the colonies, the Stuart monarchy became suddenly interested in sailing West in the end of the 16th century. After the foundation of what would become Plantagenia and the Seven Republics, Hans III, the King of the North desired his share of the cake. The Icelandic explorer Christian Eriksson was hired and went on exploring the coasts of what is now Vinland. Referring to the old sagas, he identified several regions as the ones of the sagas and popularized the use of Vinland as a name for the region upon his return in Copenhagen. His numerous expeditions would lead him to fund several towns, the most famous being Erikshavn (1570), “Erik's port” named after the heir to the Kalmar Union, which would become over the years the most important city of the Nordic colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145131.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS132.D;Vinland was the last European colony to be founded in the New-World and the low Scandinavian population made it also the less populated of the continent. The colony was based on the trade of furs, mainly beavers which were highly wanted in 17th century Europe and many settlers were only interested in this trade, making money and coming back to the homeland where they enjoyed a new position. The Religious Conflicts and the first border conflicts with New Burgundy led the Scandinavians to soon take measures to encourage immigration in the area. The end of the Imperial War of Religion would see an important emigration of Germans from Pomerania to Vinland where they would soon form an important part of the population. The seizure of Galatia (Sudurhafeyjar) in the same war would however divert many potential colonists to the rich waters of the Caribbean.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145132.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS133.D;With a low population whose main concern was trade, Vinland experimented a very different relation with the natives than New-Burgundy or Plantagenia. Diplomatic relations were soon established between Scandinavia and the Iroquois, the Inuit and the Cree nations. The subsequent treaties which were signed guaranteed the land of the tribes (after some “rectifications” by the Vinlandic settlers) in exchange of the submission to the Nordic throne and a commercial monopoly for Scandinavia. This would lead to a rise of the trade of furs and also influence of Scandinavia which soon ruled over all the Great Lakes. The Nordic explorers would also often embark on travels inland which would lead to the mapping of most of North Arcadia by 1750 and the emergence of the Rohnst people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145133.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS134.D;However the rise of the settler population provoked a clash between the Crown and her colony. Reclaiming more lands and more rights the settlers would often ask for renegotiating the treaties with the “Skraelings”, a move the crown was not keen to do because of the influence she exerted over Arcadia because of the same treaties. The situation would tense over the years, the final blow being the new taxes for financing the German Wars leading to the Vinlandic War of Independence in 1808. The Loyalists were soon crushed and the tribes were forced to negotiate new treaties in favour of the settlers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145134.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS135.D;However the Iroquois Confederation would ask for the protection of the newly independent Belgium, giving the Septimen an access to the Great Lakes. This would mark the first step of hostilities between Vinland and the Seven Republics. Initially, a Treaty signed in neutral Talahasi in 1809 would see the Iroquois Confederate boundary split, with two-thirds going to Vinland and the remainder staying with the Seven Republics. But tensions continued as the rise of the concept of Arcadianism grew stronger. Finally, the threat of the Seven Republics grew too big to simply deal with by diplomacy. Securing an alliance with the Kingdom of Plantagenia, they declared war on the Seven Republics, triggering the War of the Double Alliance (1819-1821). The War was seen as nothing short of a disaster. The lack of population from Vinland proved to be the crucial factor in its defeat and loss of territory stipulated by the Treaty of Erikshavn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145135.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS136.D;Now Vinland stands at a crossroad. It is the biggest nation in Arcadia but also the less populated and both Plantagonian and Septimen are interested to get their share of the Great Lakes. The debate on the Natives situation has grown stronger over the years, stimulated by the opening of the colonization of the inner and northern parts of Arcadia and it may be time for Vinland to eventually choose the fate of the Skraelings. Adding to this situation, the emigration of Iroquois from Septimen territory preferring Vinlandic rule than Septiman exploitation. Moreover Arcadianism has spread to the ideological spheres of Vinland and some are already advocating the idea of Vinland spreading from one ocean to the other and becoming the sole great power of Arcadia.?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145136.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS140.D;Amazonie was first explored by Spanish explorers during the expeditions of Amerigo Vespucci and was amongst the lands reserved for the Spanish with the treaty of Pamplona. However the violations of the treaty by the Spanish, made the Anglo-French feel not bind by it. The first colony founded was St-George in what was called France Equinoxiale (because near the Equator, days and nights barely last around the same time). The settlements were scarce and the area was clearly void of any occupation outside of the coastal ports of St-George and Bethléem. By 1574, the Spanish and French agreed on a new border on the Amazon River with all East and South territories left to Anglo-French colonisation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145140.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS140.T;History of Amazonie;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS141.D;A new movement of colonisation began in the 1610. Attracted by the riches of the “Tribute” Fleet from Peru, many settlers installed on the northeastern tip of Ameriga in what was called “France Antarctique” (Antarctic France meaning the opposite of the Arctic Climate). The immigration there, strengthened by the Atlantic Trade would be unregulated for years, Port Liberté being founded by a Breton pirate around 1640 and only integrated in the viceroyalty of France Antarctique after the construction of a royal fort in the bay. The area would prove to be a pirates’ nest for the whole century, culminating in what some people called the “Golden Age of Piracy” debuting during the Imperial War and continuing with various successes for the rest of the century and ending with the elimination of the last “true pirate”, Bartholomew Roberts in a fight with his old friend Olivier Levasseur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145141.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS142.D;The Antarctiqual colonisation was sponsored by “La Compagnie de l’Antarctique” founded in St-Malo by Breton and Guyennese merchants. Decided to put to use the vast territories void of human presence, they bought many lands in the colony, creating grand domains using slaves workforce and settling there many settlers. Contrary to the Jewel of the Crown which was Plantagenia, Amazonia would see a predominantly French and Breton colonisation and almost no English settlers, the Puritans attracting the people who fled the Dual-Monarchy. Slavery was the main motor of the expansion of the colony becoming the first sugar producer in the whole world after 1700. Conflicts would often erupt on the southern border with Lotharian settlers although the whole Atlantian area became a city of exchange between the Burgundian and Anglo-French colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145142.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS143.D;Penetration of the interior was hard because of the climate and it is only by 1790 that most of Amazonie was fully claimed and colonized. The settlers of the East took control of Gouas and Monts-Diamants while Equinoxian settlers would settle Vaura. The War of Succession caused no real change for the colony with only Equinoxia taking a side during the war and sending men to Charles. This act was punished after the war by the reunion of the two vice-royalties into Amazonie, administered in Port-Liberté. The little freedom Equinoxia had was lost and Equinoxian became bitter with the rule of the monarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145143.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS144.D;The ideas of the German Wars erupted in Amazonia but caused no real riot except in St-Georges where Equinoxian were ready to take up arms against the oppressor. The governor of the colony dialogated with revolters but was ultimately forced to leave in 1825. The success of the Lotharian Independence and the ongoing Spanish-Colombian Wars had only strengthened the revolutionary party. An assembly was called in Port-Liberté to choose the new Constitution of the country. In the end, the Amazonian Federation was declared with the constituent republics of Equinoxie and Antarctique being equals in the terms of power and jurisdiction. However the size and the population of the Eastern Part soon allowed the politics to not mind the Equinoxian inhabitants. Thus slavery was only abolished in the Western Parts while the Eastern planters retained their workforce.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145144.A;Interesting...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
SS145.D;Profiting from the Lotharingian Civil War, the Amazonian government moved its army to Atlantia and integrated it in the Federation although the claim is still unrecognized by the Lotharingian government and by the local population. Amazonia stands now at a crucial point in its history : Equinoxian are looking west, up the Amazon to settle new lands but who knows what effects it could have with Gran Colombia ? The Antarctic people are now looking south and a similar idea to Arcadianism has spread over some politics, the “Amerigan Ideal”. The balance in the country is already shaking and with potential enemies in the North and a revanchist dictatorship in the South, who knows what awaits the only democracy of the Amerigan continent ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
145145.A;A united Ameriga would be a good thing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The personal union of Denmark, Norway and Sweden survives and evolves to a unitary state and integrates Scotland with the Stuarts leading the Union. Isabella of Spain married a Portuguese prince, instead of Ferdinand II. The Chenghua Emperor does not stop Ming China's explorations, but decides to pursue them with greater zeal than before.

EVTDESC17150;The (so-called) Cat and Mouse Act was an infamous British law passed in 1912 in order to combat the suffragette tactic of using hunger strikes as a means to build sympathy for the Suffragette cause.

Une loi similaire est en cours dans l'un de nos États pour assurer un traitement similaire aux grèves de la faim entreprises par les suffragettes.;Das (so genannte) Katz- und Mausgesetz war ein berüchtigtes britisches Gesetz, das im Jahr 1912 verabschiedet wurde, um der Hungerstreiktaktik zum Erheischen von Sympathie der Frauenrechtlerinnen entgegen zu wirken. Das Gesetz besagte, dass eine Person aus dem Gefängnis entlassen werden konnte, um sich von einer schweren Krankheit zu erholen ... nur um die Haft nach der Erholung fortzusetzen. Damit sprach sich die Regierung von aller Verantwortung für etwaige gesundheitlichen Schäden frei, die sich die fragliche Frau durch den Hungerstreik zuziehen konnte.

We must strive for the betterment of ourselves, and of our communities, by expelling from them, once and for all, the pernicious influence of the spirit in the bottle, and raise our eyes, instead, to the spirit in the sky.'\n\nThe Temperance movement has been gaining traction in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ religious circles, and a tent meeting held in one of our states is a prime expression of that sentiment.;;Denn es liegt nicht in der Natur eines Menschen von echtem, ungetrübtem Glauben, sein Leben in den Fesseln eines unterdrückenden und ungebremsten Lasters zu vergeuden. Wir müssen uns selber und unsere Gemeinden zur Besserung führen, indem wir ein für allemal den garstigen Einfluss des Geistes in der Flasche vernichten und unsere Augen stattdessen dem heiligen Geist im Himmel entgegenheben. '\n\nDie Abstinenzbewegung bekommt in den $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Religionskreisen immer mehr Einfluss.

EVTNAME160;Licensing Act;Le Licensing Act;Lizenzgesetz;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160;Influenced by intensive lobbying from the Temperance League, one of our states has adopted a licensing regulation that allows residents the right to issue or retract liquor licenses in their local districts. With strong public support, the Licensing Act has thus prohibited the sale of liquor throughout the state. Many local breweries have been denied the right to sell their produce locally, and have been forced into bankruptcy.;;Beeinflusst durch intensives Lobbying der Abstinenzlerbewegung hat einer unserer Staaten ein Lizenzgesetz verabschiedet, das den Bürgern das Recht zugesteht, Alkohollizenzen in ihren Distrikten zurückzuziehen. Mit starker öffentlicher Unterstützung hat das Lizenzgesetz somit den Verkauf von Alkohol im gesamten Staat unterbunden.

EVTDESC170;For if we are to set ourselves and our brethren free from the devastating tribulations and degenerations of alcohol and alcoholism, nothing serves us better than complete and total abstinence, always. What good would it do us to be free of our capitalist oppressors, only to find ourselves soon oppressed by the twin tyrannies of vice and ugly habits?'\n\nSince the negative effects of widespread alcoholism have hit the poorest classes the hardest, the temperance league has managed to find allies for itself within the socialist movement. Local labour agitators in one of our states are arguing against the use of alcohol.;;Denn wenn wir uns und unsere Brüder von der zerstörerischen Drangsal und Degeneration des Alkohols und des Alkoholismus befreien wollen, so kann uns nichts besser dienen als komplette und totale Abstinenz auf immer. Was hätten wir davon, von unseren kapitalistischen Unterdrückern frei zu sein, nur um uns stattdessen unter dem Zwillingsjoch von Laster und schlechten Gewohnheiten wiederzufinden?'\n\nDa die negativen Effekte von weit verbreitetem Alkoholismus die ärmsten Klassen am schlimmsten getroffen haben, hat die Abstinenzlerbewegung bei den Sozialisten Verbündete gefunden.

From neighboring countries, and from secret, underground breweries and distilleries everywhere, an army of unseen works around the clock to bring the public the finest choices of paint thinners, wood spirits and moonshine.

Speaking in parliament, the conservative group leader has opined that he belives that the measures can be enacted, as an experiment with national policy, if nothing else. Citing fears of public discontent with the present plight of the unemployed, his group will back a proposal for modest unemployment benefits. Liberals in parliament remain wholly unconvinced of the proposition, but not enacting the proposal will be seen as a lost opportunity by those pushing for reform.;;Ich glaube, dass wir zu einer Vereinbarung kommen können.'\n\nDie Einführung der Arbeitslosenunterstützung wird von einer Oberhausmehrheit unterstützt. Der Sprecher der konservativen Gruppe trug im Parlament vor, dass man die Maßnahmen zumindest versuchsweise in Kraft zu setzen. Die Gruppe begründet ihre Unterstützung einer einfachen Arbeitslosenunterstützung mit der Furcht vor wachsendem öffentlichen Unmut wegen der fortwährend hohen Arbeitslosigkeit. Die Liberalen im Parlament sind von dem Vorschlag weiterhin alles andere als überzeugt, aber die Nichtverabschiedung dieser Gesetzesvorlage würde von den Reformbefürwortern als verpasste Gelegenheit angesehen werden.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC98607;Our diplomacy has proven successful: $COUNTRY$ has been granted full autonomy, on the condition that friendly ties be maintained with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98607.A;We are most fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98608.D;It appears the threat of a war of independence was enough to secure $COUNTRY$'s freedom. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to cheer on our Independence Day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98608.A;We are most fortunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98610;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98610;It appears the time for diplomacy has ended. We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government that they have demanded independence-- or it will be war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98610.A;Then it is war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98610.B;We shall let them go. For now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98611;Must We Fight Alone?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however. Since we have no recourse, secretly approaching some of the enemies of our overlord might gain us some allies in the war to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98611.A;Attempt to find allies... quietly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98611.B;There is no need for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98612;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98612.A;Agree to the alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98612.B;No, this is too risky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98613.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98613.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to our secret alliance. Whether they will indeed help once the war begins remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98613.A;It gives us hope.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98614.T;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98614.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our request. Hopefully they don't inform our overlords of our intent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98614.A;Bah!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
222120.T; Flight to Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
222120.D; The defeat is total for the Venetians. They have been pushed away from their homeland by the Italian nationalists. But they still hold many holdings in the East, where their government fled. Upon entering the city of Athens, the Doge was forced by the Greeks to proclaim an Hellenic Republic while still holding his old title. A new state has emerged from the ashes of the Serenessima, what will it become ? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
222120.A;We are true Hellens now;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE1.T;Greek Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE1.D;Venice's hold of Greece has been tedious since the beginning of the occupation during the Ottoman collapse. With the liberal movement gaining weight at home, the Greek nationalists have become more audacious over time. They reclaim an assembly of all Greeks to decide their future in the Republic. If this council is not held, this could lead to the rise of a rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100601.A;Let them host their little council, what could possibly go wrong ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100601.B;We will not accept it. Greece is Venice's demesne;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE2.T;Opening of the Council of Athens;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE2.D;The Greek council finally opens in Athens, the magnificent city of Ancient Greece. Three great factions have formed over the previous months : the Zimisceses, followers of the general who helped Venice "protect" Greece 20 years ago, who want to establish an independent Greek state, the Exarchates, who want to acquire more autonomy, and the Pireans or "Italians", loyalists of Venice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100602.A;Let it begin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE3.T;The result of the Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE3.D;It is finally the end of the Council, what will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100603.A;Let us hear the results of the council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE4.T;The Council of Athens : Zimisceses' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE4.D;The Zimisceses have won the majority of the votes during the Council. Zimisces has profited from the occasion to declare the independence of Greece, and has rallied most of the Greek soldiers around him;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100604.A;Secession is not an option !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE5.T;The Council of Athens : Exarchates' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE5.D;The Exarchates have won the majority of the votes during the Council. They now ask for autonomy under the protection of Venice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100605.A;We will give them Home Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100605.B;Autonomy is not an option;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE6.T;Failure of the Exarchates' proposition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE6.D;Venice refusing Home Rule for the Greeks has led the Exarchates to rally with the Zimisceses and to proclaim the independence of Greece. Most of continental Greece is already in their control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100606.A;Secession is not an option !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE7.T;The Council of Athens : Pireans' Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE7.D;Unexpectedly, the Venetians loyalists won the majority of the vote during the Council. They are ready to stay under the government of Venice but only if Venice reforms itself and give the same political rights to Greeks as the Italians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100607.A;Venice will reform itself;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100607.B;Political rights for Greeks ? What is this madness ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE8.T;Pireans failure;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE8.D;Venice has refused the chart proposed by the Loyalists. It has discredited them and most of the Greek representatives have rallied around Zimisces. Nearly all of continental Greece is now under their control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100608.A;Secession is not an option !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE9.T;Council of Athens : No majority;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE9.D;No majority has emerged from the Council. Angered by the indecision of the politicians, the Greek general and war hero Zimisces has rallied his supportes in Thessalia and Attica and is determined to deliver Greece from the Italian oppressors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100609.A;We will crush Zmisceses !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE10.T;Fight for Freedom !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE10.D;We are at war with Venice for our freedom. Let us collect all we need for our fight !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100610.A;Greece will be free !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE11.T;Question of Crete;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE11.D;The island of Crete has not seceded along other provinces but the Greeks nationalists have spread their venom all over the island. A local assembly is held in Iraklion on the stance to adopt during the war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100611.A;How will it evolve ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE12.T;Loyalists won;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE12.D;The Pireans have convinced the population of Crete to stay under our rule and fight against the rebels !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100612.A;They have made the wise choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE13.T;Exarchates won;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE13.D;Cretans declared their neutrality in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100613.A;At least, they did not join Zimisces ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE14.T;Zimisceses victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE14.D;The Cretans have proclaimed the island of Crete to be a full part of Greece !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100614.A;We shall overcome anyway !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE15.T;Question of Cyprus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE15.D;The island of Cyprus has not seceded along other provinces but the Greeks nationalists have spread their venom all over the island. A local assembly is held in Nicosia on the stance to adopt during the war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100615.A;How will it evolve ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE31.T;Pireans' Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE31.D;Cyprus has chosen to stay under Venice dominion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100631.A;They have made the wise choice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE16.T;Exarchates won;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE16.D;Cyprus declared neutrality in the ongoing war under the influence of the Exarchates;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100616.A;At least, they did not join Zimisces ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE17.T;Zimisceses victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE17.D;The Cypriots have proclaimed the island of Cyprus to be a full part of Greece !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100617.A;We shall overcome anyway !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE18.T;The treaty of Corfu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE18.D;The war with Greece has been lost. Guaranteed by Aragon and Bohemia, Zimisces has forces the signature of an humiliating treaty on the island of Corfu. Greece will be independent and Venice will free the territories under its control and relinquish any claims on Greek territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100618.A;For the good of $COUNTRY$, we must retreat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE19.T;The Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE19.D;Greece has won its independence by the treaty of Corfu, but now a new problem arises. Zimisces has had all powers during the revolution but not everybody is ready to agree with it. A new Greek council has been called in Delphi to settle the question.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100619.A;A second council will be organised soon to decide of Greece's future;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE20.T;Greek Rebellion Crushed !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE20.D;Venice has reclaimed all rebels' territory ! Zimisces has been arrested and executed in the city of Athens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100620.A;Venice is here for a long time !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE21.T;End of the war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE21.D;Venice has won the war. It would be now time to join back....;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100621.A;We will join back the fold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE22.T;Crete comes back;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE22.D;Seeing our victory the Cretans have proposed to join the Serenissima.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100622.A;At last !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE23.T;End of the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE23.D;Greece has won its independence. It is now the time to unite with them;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100623.A;We will join back the fold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE24.T;Crete joins Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE24.D;With our victory, we have proved to the Cretans that the right choice was to join us;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100624.A;At last !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE25.T;End of the war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE25.D;Venice has won against Zimisces. It would be wise to join them back;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100625.A;We will join back the fold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE26.T; Cyprus comes back;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE26.D; The Cypriots are coming back after the war;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100626.A;At last !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100627.A;We will join back the fold...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE28.T;Cyprus joins Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE28.D;With our victory, we have proved to the Cypriots that the right choice was to join us;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100628.A;At last !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE29.T;A new council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE29.D;Greece has won its independence, but now a new problem arises. Zimisces has had all powers during the revolution but not everybody is ready to agree with it. A new Greek council has been called in Delphi to settle the question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100629.A;A second council will be organised soon to decide of Greece's future;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE30.T;Zimisces' rebels !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE30.D;After the interdiction of the council of Athens, Greek nationalists have radicalized. They founded the secret society of Filiki Eteria and recruited new members all over the Greek territory. They rose led by the general and war hero Zimisces who has proclaimed the independence of a new Greek state !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100630.A;We will crush Zmisceses !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE40.T;Opening of the Delphi Council ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE40.D;A new council is held in Greece. This time, the Greek representatives have assembled to discuss the draft of a constitution and there are already different factions opposing each other. First the Zimisceses, who defend a strong monarchy under Zimisces, the war hero and current leader of the state. There is also the Alexandros faction, who support the election of the king of Macedonia to the Greek throne but with more restrictions on the power of monarch. Finally the Pericles faction which wants to institute a real Republic. No matter what the result will be, the shadow of Zimisces is always present and he could try to take power for himself;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106040.A;Let us begin this second council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE41.T;Opening of the Delphi Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE41.D;It is the end of the Delphi Council;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106041.A;What will be the result ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE42.T;Delphi Council : Zimisceses resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE42.D;The Greek representatives have decided to give the power to the current leader Konstantinos Zimisces, who will be crowned king of the Hellens. An assembly will be called, and political liberties are guaranteed but the king retains much of the power;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106042.A;Long Live Konstantinos Zimisces, king of the Hellens !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE43.T;Delphi Council : Alexandros resolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE43.D;The Greek representatives have chosen to unite with Macedonia. But it will be at the coast of many political reforms asked by the liberals. Moreover Zimisces seems to be ready to launch a coup to claim power. What will happen ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106043.A;We will call the king of Macedonia to be crowned !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106043.B;Zimisces seizes the power for himself;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE44.T;The crown of Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE44.D;The Supporters of the Macedonian king have succeeded during the council of Athens. But they are saying that in exchange of the crown, the monarch will have to rescind its power and give a democratic assembly to the people and stop the multicultural policy started in Macedonia. That's the cost for allying the liberals to the idea. But we could enter Greece by force and take Athens to force them to bow to our conditions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106044.A;We will not accept the crown of the gutter ! We will have Greece by conquest !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106044.B;We are a Greek state now !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE45.T;The Macedonian attack !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE45.D;The king of Macedonia has refused the reforms of the liberals and is determined to take Greece under its conditions. To face him, the assembly has elected Zimisces king of the Greeks and hope that he can force him out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106045.A;We will crush the Macedonians ! All hail Zimisces !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE46.T;Zimisces Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE46.D;Zimisces has seized the power despite the choice of our king in the council. We must march on Athens and take what is ours from this upstart general !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106046.A;We will take what is ours !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE47.T;Macedonian Victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE47.D;We have taken the city of Athens and captured Zimisces. He has been promptly executed and the Greek government has proclaimed the end of the war !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106047.A;Greece is ours !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE48.T;Zimisces Rebellion !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE48.D;Since the union of Greece and Macedonia, Zimisces has been plotting against the new monarch hoping to seize power in its place. Large tracts of Greece have risen in favor of Zimisces. We must crush him !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106048.A;We will crush Zimisces !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE49.T;Zimisces victory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE49.D;Macedonia is utterly vainquished and the king has already fled to Aragon. Long live Zimisces !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106049.A;Greece is united under Zimisces !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE50.T;Council of Delphi : Pericles' victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE50.D; The Council of Delphi has led to the establishment of a new Hellen Democracy. Let us hope that the Republic will bring us to glory !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106050.A;Long Live the new Hellen Republic !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE51.T;Coup d'Etat !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE51.D;Zimisces has been plotting since the establishment of the Republic to gain power. Today he has entered Athens and asked the military to help him end the political squabbles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106051.A;Zimisces plot fails and the Republic lives on !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106051.B;Zimisces succeeds in his plot and he is proclaimed king of Hellas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE52.T;Council of Delphi : Zimisces Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE52.D;Seeing that no majority emerged from the Council, Zimisces took action and seized power. He must now face both the anger of the Macedonians and the democrats !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106052.A;Long Live Konstantinos Zimisces, king of the Hellens !;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE53.T;The Greek Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE53.D;Greece has been beaten by Venice who now occupies once again the cradle of Western Civilization. We have an opportunity to proclaim Macedonia the true heir of Alexander by supporting the Greek Cause and thus gaining the support of the oppressed populations of Hellas...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106053.A;We will protect the Greeks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106053.B;Venice is powerful and Greece is not our primary interest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106054.T;Macedonian Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106054.D;The traitorous Macedonians have launched a campaign to end our state!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106054.A;The time of Philip and Alexander is over!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN1.T;Intervention in the Aegean ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN1.D;Our intervention in Greece some years allowed us to secure mainland Greece, greatly enhancing our position among the Mediterranean powers. The Turkish Civil War is not yet over and the islands of the Aegean seem ripe for the conquest. The delicescent state of the Sultanate allows us such actions without actions from other powers and we have the support of some local Greek nationalist cells to help us. The most daring of our strateges have suggested that we could try to seize the port of Izmir which is populated by many Greek but such an action would certainly mean an Ottoman reaction;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106060.A;Seize the Egean Islands!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106060.B;Smyrna is a worthy target ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106060.C;Our Greek holdings are enough to manage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN2.T;Venetian Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN2.D;The Republic of Venice has decided to complete what they began years ago by seizing the islands of the Aegean we still controlled. It is now a 'fait accompli' and trying to reclaim them would bring on us the wrath of their allies...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106061.A;We have enough problems as it stands, leave them be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106061.B;The vultures will be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN3.T;Ottoman response;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN3.D;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to attack us after our takeover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106062.A;Then it is truly war!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN4.T;Venetian attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN4.D;The Republic of Venice, fostered by our current state has taken over the Aegean islands and even the port of Izmir! We can't let those pesky merchants have a march in the heart of Anatolia but we must be ready to face them and their allies ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106063.A;We have enough problems as it stands, leave them be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106063.B;The vultures will be punished!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN5.T;Smyrna or Izmir ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN5.D;Our hold on Izmir has allowed the local Greek movement to rise and the city is now seen as an integral part of a possible Greek state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106064.A;Smyrna, Izmir, it's all the same for me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN6.T;The opening of the Biennale of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN6.D;Following the great Restoration of the city of Venice it was decided that an international art exposition would be organized in the newly built Giardini. The exposition was such a success and attracted artists from all over the world that it was decided that it should be renewed every two years.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106065.A;Who got the big prize ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN7.T;The Most Serene Republic of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN7.D;The Republic of Venice has endured as an oligarchic institution since its beginnings and the government is now incredibly complicated to form with many offices separated to avoid concentration of power. As a result there has not been tyranny in the Republic but it is also a static institution that has a hard time evolving with the current times. The Doges for example are now only an honorific post with little power, despite being the Head of State from their election to their death. An election requires a lot of draws to designate the candidates and the votes needed a significant majority to work. This prestige position is currently held by the former admiral Silvestro Dandolo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106066.A;Tradition is good;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN8.T;The death of the Doge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN8.D;Silvestro Dandolo died yesterday in the Palace of the Doges at the honorable age of 81. He was a major actor in the Venetian intervention in Greece, even going to Athens after the truce to ciment Venetian hold on Greece. He was less active during the recent years because of his old age but he managed to make acceptable some reforms of the Doge's election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106067.A;He will be missed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN9.T;Election of the 122th Doge of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN9.D;The election of the Doge has seen the opposition between Reformers and Conservatives erupt in open day, with three men being plausible candidates. Daniele Manin, not related to the 120th Doge, is a Liberal jurist known for being one of the heads of the Reformaters faction. Opposing him is ANtonio Salviati, a conservative noble known for his interest in industry and in maintaining the status quo. Outside those two polarized figures is Giovanni Battista Giuseppe Albrizzi, son of the Greek poetess Isabella Albrizzi, a neutral candidate known for his taste in art and literature, and also a known philhellen. The election will be seen as a sign toward the crowds of the Republic, one way or the other.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106068.A;Daniele Manin will be Doge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106068.B;Antonio Salviati is the new Doge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106068.C;Giovanni Battista Giuseppe Albrizzi seems the best choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN10.T;Death of Daniele Manin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN10.D;Daniele Manin, the 122th Doge of Venice has died yesterday in his office. A known liberal, Manin was known as the Doge of the people, often hailed for his support of reform of the Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106069.A;He will be missed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN11.T;Death of Antonio Salviati;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN11.D;Antonio Salviati, the 122th Doge of Venice has died yesterday in the Palace of the Doges. A close friend of the Venetian oligarchy and a known captain of industry he was not particularly not loved by the lower classes but his death marks the end of a new era for the Republic with the first open Doge election of the Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106070.A;He will be missed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN12.T;Death of Giovanni Albrizzi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN12.D;Giovanni Albrizzi, the 122th Doge of Venice has died yesterday in the Giardini where an art exposition was held. A known sponsor of the arts, he funded several artists throughout his office, not taking part in politics, and often acting as an eccentric character.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106071.A;He will be missed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN13.T;The election of the 123th Doge of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN13.D;This election is historic because of the reforms underwent in the previous years. The Doge will be elected by the whole electorate after the process of selection has been made. Three candidates have arisen. The Conservatives support Pietro Bertolini, an important official in the Stato da Mar and colonial governor. The Liberals have supported Alessandro Guicciolli, a reknown diplomat who has gone through the various capitals of Europe to represent the Republic. Meanwhile the Socialists support the eccentric Filipo Grimani, a devout Christian supporting the Socialists in their efforts of establishing a juster society. Let the people cast their vote!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106072.A;Alessandro Guiccioli will be Doge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106072.B;Filipo Bertolini is the new Doge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106072.C;Pietro Grimani seems the best choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN14.T;The Abolishment of the Doge office;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN14.D;The changes in our government have made this office moot and void and we ahve thus decided to end it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106073.A;Gone is this relic of the past!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN15.T;The 1500th Anniversary of the founding of Venice;;;;;;;;;;;;;
VEN15.D;The 25th March is the traditional date of the founding of our city. Fleeing Gothic and Huns invaders, Roman citizens poured in the laguna, hoping to find a shelter against the invaders. Now the City still stands independent a millenia and a half after its foundation, a true proof of Venetian prowess and spirit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106074.A;Our Republic is truly the Most Serene of all!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE90.T;Reestablishment of the Ecumenical Patriarchate;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE90.D;With Constantinople once again the capital of the Hellen state, the Patriarchate of Constantinoplehas regained its power with the Patriarch of Greece being nominated as the new Ecumenical Patriarch. The magnificent Hagia Sophia has been reconsecrated as an Orthodox Church and will now host again the most important religious ceremonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106090.A;May it never change!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE91.T;The Thracian Catastrophe;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE91.D;Conflicting Greek and Turkish nationalism have provoked hatred among the common people of Thrace. With the Enosis complete the Orthodox citizens backlashed against their Turkish neighbours, forcing them to leave their homes in violent pogroms. Many Turkish died and the state let it do, even encouraging Greeks from the rest of the country to come here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106091.A;Good for us I guess ?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE92.T;Orthodox Revival;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE92.D;Following Greek independence from Venice the Orthodox Church, which had played a great role in the independence process began a great revival movement, often at the expanse of the state which didn't look at it in a good way. Wandering monks taught common people to read the Bible, seminaries were opened to instruct priests in the ways of the faith and new synods were held. Overall it helped improve literacy but the Church became more powerful, often opposing the new Enlightenment ideas that Venice had helped spread in the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106092.A;The Holy Church should not intervene in those matters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE93.T;The Greek-Bulgarian Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE93.D;Because of Greek dominance over the Balkans and its supports in the government we have agreed to sign a treaty that recognizes Greek claims over East Macedonia. In exchange, much of the Bulgarian people living in Greece will be sent to our country while we will send the Greeks in our country to Greece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106093.A;It might be better ...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE94.T;The Greek-Bulgarian Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
GRE94.D;It is our time to respect the Treaty by 'helping' Bulgarian in our country to find their way home;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106094.A;It is settled!;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC12000;The black smoke pouring out from the pit, in long, drawn out billows, reeks of coal and fire, and the intensity of the smell almost drowns out an undertone of burnt flesh. A hurried commotion breaks out as the survivors of a The Great Explosion of $YEAR$ scurry to save what is left of the coal mine. The seams in the coalfield lie, sleeping for centuries, embedded in pockets of methane.

Ein solches Vorhaben wäre eine exzellente Gelegenheit, dem Rest der Welt die wirtschaftlichen und kulturellen Stärken unserer Kolonien vorzustellen, und könnte unseren Exporten sehr unter die Arme greifen, indem es die Güter unseres Reichs auf der Weltbühne bekannt macht, und auch bei den Bürgern in der Heimat um Unterstützung für das Reich wirbt. Sollten wir diese Idee unterstützen?;;;;;;;;;;;
