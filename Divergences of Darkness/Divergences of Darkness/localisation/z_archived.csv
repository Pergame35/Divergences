EVTNAME999000;National Debate: Trade Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999000;Let the debate take its own course, and let the chips fall where they may!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999000;Freedom of trade shall not perish from this Earth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999001;National Debate: Economic Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999001;The debate had been going on for several hours, when a candidate stepped forward and presented arguments for their cause which silenced all opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999001;Decisive arguments for Laissez Faire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999001;Decisive arguments for Interventionism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999001;Decisive arguments for State Capitalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999001;Decisive arguments for Planned Economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999002;National Debate: Religious Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country's view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999002;There are no Gods!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999002;Religion is not a political issue!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999002;Let the people have their faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999002;There is one faith and one faith only!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999003;National Debate: Citizenship Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999003;Give them residency.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999003;We need to limit their citizenship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999003;Let them have full citizenship.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999004;National Debate: War Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999004;Patriots and pacifists are fighting in the townhouse, using words to hurt and kill their enemies. A long since dead and buried dispute between $COUNTRY$ and its neighbor has once again shown its ugly head. Patriots wish to invade the country while pacifists believe that there are other ways to resolve the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999004;We are patriots and we are going to fight for our country!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB999004;Violence can be used, but in this situation it would be meaningless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999004;War between countries is never good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999004;This can be solved without violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999020;Calm Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention,  and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999020;There shall be peace and quite in our time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999021;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occured in several large factories, with incidents of streetfighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999021;Outrageous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA999032;We will have an eye on this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999040;A reform is long past due - issue a new voting right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999041;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999041;We shall do this right away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999042;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999042;Better now than later.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999043;Voting Rights Discussion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTC999043;Equal votes for equal chances - NOW!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME999050;Unemployment Issues;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTD999049;Do not get involved in the debate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10222;The French Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10222;Angry crowds have flooded the streets of Paris, shouting cries of 'Down with the King!' and 'Long live the Reform!'. They have erected barricades in the streets and fighting has broken out with the Parisian municipal guards. With the city having been completely closed off from outside help, these crowds have begun to march on the royal palace. Our king has had no choice but to abdicate and flee the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10223;Louis-Napoleon's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10223;Facing the prospect of losing the presidential election, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10224;Emperor Napoleon Deposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10224;Angered by the inability of France to prevent the formation of Germany, as well as the humiliating loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the government has deposed Emperor Napoleon. We must choose what form our new government is to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11104;Revolution in $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11104;A pro-$UNION_ADJ$ revolution has taken hold in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Its liberal leaders believe that $COUNTRY$ is the nation best-suited to unite all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, and thus have sworn to support us until the union is ready to occur.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11106;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11106;$MONARCHTITLE$, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador has presented us with news from the recent parliament of German revolutionaries. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to assemble a federation of German states, with the goal of eventually forming a greater Germany. If we do not agree,it is possible that $FROMCOUNTRY$ will attempt to take our lands by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11108;Slavic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11108;The call has gone out for the Slavic nations of the Balkans to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Austrians and Turks as well as other European powers. Yugoslavia, it is said, will be a power to rival even its most powerful neighbours. Whether this new nation would succeed in holding together a people divided by centuries of bitter warfare is best left for speculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11109;The Creation of Greater Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11109;The call has gone out for the Ugric nations of Greater Finland to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Russians as well as other European powers. This new nation, it is said, will be a power to rival even its most powerful neighbours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11110;A North German Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11110;An open discussion amongst liberals in $COUNTRY$ has been occurring regarding the formation of a confederation of North German states. Conditions have never been right for it in the past, but many believe such a union is needed if the Germans are ever to have true security and take their place among the powers of the world. A $COUNTRY_ADJ$-led movement to create such a confederation might go over well with our neighbours, if we made the attempt to create it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13240_NEW;The oil lamp flickered, casting an orange, sooty glow across the moist brown of the cargo hold. The average ship docking in $COUNTRY$ carried very little to raise an eyebrow, but years of being fooled and fooled again by foreign merchants, trying to dodge some excise or other, had left him with a sixth sense for when things were out of order. A rat scurrying between some crates tipped him off. A sweet, pungent scent too familiar not to be alluring. Opium. A cargo hold full of opium.;;Die Öllampe flackerte und schien ein rußig-oranges Glühen über das feuchte Braun des Frachtraums. Das durchschnittlich aussehende Schiff, das in $PROVINCENAME$ vor Anker lag, führte wenig mit sich, das auch nur ein Augenbrauenheben verursachen würde, doch Jahre der Erfahrung mit ausländischen Kaufleuten, die immer wieder versuchten, ihn aufs Kreuz zu legen und Steuern zu umgehen, hatten ihm einen sechsten Sinn dafür eingebracht, wann etwas nicht in Ordnung war. Eine zwischen einigen Kisten umherhuschende Ratte hatte es ihm verraten. Ein süßlicher Geruch, zu vertraut, um nicht verlockend zu wirken. Opium. Ein ganzer Frachtraum voller Opium.;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13365;Boxers Occupy Foreign-Held Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13365;The Righteous Society of Harmonious Fists have invaded lands currently owned by a colonial power, but which rightfully belong to the Chinese. More than that, they have successfully occupied the territory and rebuffed efforts by westerners to take it back. We can attempt to stake our claim over the land once again," though if we do it is all but tantamount to a declaration of war-- and, considering the state the Qing Empire is in", it might be a war in which we stand to lose more than we gained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME13370;The Boxers Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC13370;$CAPITAL$ has been occupied by the Righteous Society of Harmonious Fists, who have successfully driven foreign influence out of the country and restored it to its traditional policies of isolationism. What repercussions this will cause with the western powers remains to be seen, but for the moment the Empire stands triumphant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16401;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Applies For Statehood!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16401;Yesterday morning we recieved a petition from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, requesting Statehood in the United States of Central America. A state constitution has been submitted, along with maps defining the state's territorial boundries. Common opinion seems to hold it a forgone conclusion that we will accept this petition for statehood and forever join $FROMCOUNTRY$ into our prosperous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32509_NEW;the Alaskan Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32509_NEW;We hear word from the Russian ambassador that they are willing to sell their Alaskan colony to us, for the right price. Perhaps we should consider making an offer before someone else snaps it up? The land isn't worth much at the moment, but owning Alaska would be a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32510_NEW;the Alaskan Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32510_NEW;We have received an offer from $FROMCOUNTRY$ to purchase the Alaskan colony. Should we accept?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32512;Intervention in Hungary?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32512;The Hungarian revolution in Austria sets a dangerous precedent. There are far too many minorities in $COUNTRY$ who might look to the Hungarians as an inspiration, and who would rise up as well if we do not set a firm example. No matter our relation with the Austrian government, we must consider intervention against the Hungarian rebels or possibly face similar uprisings at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32513;The Caucasian War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32513;The Russian annexation of the Caucasus twenty years ago has met with increasing bitterness and anger among the local populace, tribal groups that are angry with the Russian administration and have declared that their homelands shall be freed from our rule. This has become a problem as rebels take to the highlands, and rooting them out may take a very long time indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32515;the Treaty of Tartu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32515;Now that Finland is free from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, their government has approached us to engage in territorial talks. They are interested in the northern strip of land known as Petsamo, and the access to the Arctic Ocean it offers, as well as discussing Russian claims to Viipuri. If we give them what they're looking for, $COUNTRY$ looks good in the eyes of the international community and we gain an ally-- but perhaps we do not need Finland as an ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32516;Russia Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32516;Russia has refused to sign the Treaty of Tartu, raising the spectre of war between our nations. Perhaps we should consider surrendering southern Karelia before the Russians come and take it from us?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32550;The Belize Purchase?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32550;Central American delegates have recently come in from London in hopes of purchasing British Belize. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32551;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32551;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to sell Belize to us! Long live the United States of Central America!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32552;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declines!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32552;$MONARCHTITLE$, negotiations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ over Belize have stalled, and they have declined to sell us the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33006;Trade For Heligoland?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33006;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposition: a trade of one of our colonial states in exchange for the island of Heligoland. It's an exorbitant price for such a small island, but the alternative would be to go to war. Shall we agree to the treaty?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33007;Germany Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33007;Germany has agreed to the proposed trade for Heligoland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33008;Germany Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33008;Germany has refused the proposed trade for Heligoland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33009;For the Glory of Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33009;The lands of Alsace-Lorraine rightfully belong in the hands of the German people. Perhaps the time has come to reclaim them from the French, and show the world what a united and glorious Germany can achieve? Either that or perhaps we should renounce our claims to those lands once and for all, despite the blow to our prestige and our pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33010;Alsace-Lorraine is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33010;We have failed to recover Alsace-Lorraine from the hated French. Many are suggesting we should renounce our claims and move on, despite the blow to our national pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33020;The League of Three Emperors;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33020;The German Kaiser has sent a delegation to $COUNTRY$ with a proposal: a resurrection of the Holy Alliance formed between Prussia, Austria and Russia which once existed after the defeat of Napoleon. It seems doubtful that such an alliance could bear fruit, but perhaps it is time to consider this idea. $COUNTRY$ has other concerns than constant conflict with the Germans, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME35305;The Guerra di Libia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC35305;The lands of Tripoli and Cyrenaica once belonged to Italy, and should again. We deserve a place in the sun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36215_NEW;Home Rule for Iceland;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36215_NEW;The Icelandic Althing has voted to request they be granted home rule, saying the time has come for greater independence. Under their plan, $COUNTRY$ would continue to manage the nation's foreign affairs and defense interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36710;The Treaty of London;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36710;In a meeting mediated by the British, the Netherlands has offered to sign a treaty which would see them relinquish all claims to Belgian territory-- but at the cost of surrendering Luxembourg to them as a vassal. Some are claiming this is too high a price, and that we should not allow ourselves to be bullied into such a treaty... but this may also be the only chance we have at peace with the Dutch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36711;Belgium Has Signed the Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36711;The Belgian government has agreed to the terms of the Treaty of London. We have surrendered all claims to their territory, in return for control over Luxembourg.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36712;Belgium Has Refused the Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36712;The Belgian government has refuse the terms of the Treaty of London. This has angered the British, but it seems the Belgians will not be moved.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36943;The New Zealand Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36943;The arrival of European settlers, known locally as Pakeha, has resulted in an increasing amount of land purchased from the Maori. While this has improved local conditions, it has angered a large portion of the Maori portion who resent the European presence and accuse the British of breaking the Treaty of Waitingi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36950;The Danish Gold Coast;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36950;The Danish Gold Coast exists on the coast of the Ashanti Union, primarily the fortress of Chistiansborg near the city of Accra. The Danish are willing to sell their holdings to us, though that is likely to result in conflict with the Ashanti government-- who will see the move as encroachment of their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36955;Conflict with Burma;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36955;A British Commodore who was recently dispatched to Burma to negotiate several matters regarding the Treaty of Yandabo, signed in 1826 after the First Anglo-Burmese War, has initiated a naval confrontation with the Burmese under questionable circumstances. While many are calling this Commodore an 'irrational jingoist', the British cannot let this matter drop without losing a great deal of prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36960;The Gold Coast Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36960;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with the hopes of negotiating a treaty. They want to solidify control over the Gold Coast in Africa, specifically by annexing our colony at Sekondi. In return, they will recognize our colonial holdings elsewhere and encourage greater cooperation between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36965;The Lagos Slave Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36965;We outlawed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ slave trade many years ago, but it continues in many African nations-- and the coastal city of Lagos in particular. Lagos has been a haven for slavers, providing unwilling natives to the trade on markets in defiance of all decent conventions. The notion has arisen that we should consider sending our ships in to liberate the natives there and establish a colony where they can receive civilized government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36966;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Seizes Lagos!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36966;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ships have sailed into Lagos, seizing the city and driving off the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison. They claim they are 'liberating' the city from slavers, extending their benevolent rule on behalf of the locals. Resisting means war, but submitting would do nothing more than prove our lack of ability to face these foreigners. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37219_NEW;Persecution of French Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37219_NEW;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In Dai Nam, the execution of several missionaries has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. This has gone nowhere, leaving us with little choice but to consider armed intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37710;Carlism Prevails;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37710;A new line of the Bourbon family has been established on the Spanish throne, descending from the Infante Carlos. To many traditionalists, this signals a rebirth of the true Spanish Empire. Others are not so optimistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37711;The First Carlist War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37711;The death of King Ferdinand in 1833 and the ascension of young Isabela (only three years old at the time) to the throne of Spain sparked a revolt by supporters of the King's brother, the Infante Carlos. He intends to depose Isabela and establish a separate branch of the Bourbon family, as well as restore the Spanish Empire to its traditional glory-- something liberals say simply cannot be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37712;The Carlists Defeated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37712;The Carlists have been routed and peace has been restored to Spain-- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37713;Return of the Carlists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37713;We thought the supporters of the Infante Carlos and his descendants had been completely routed, yet once again there are reports of a cell having been established in one of our provinces. Supporters of the current pretender are busy drumming up recruits and calling for the overthrow of the Spanish government. Rooting them out will not be easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37714;Carlist Sympathies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37714;It seems that sympathies for the Carlists among the locals in $PROVINCENAME$ have been increasing. Reports have it that another rebel cell has been established, and that a campaign of resistance against Spanish authorities has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37715;Carlist Cell Discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37715;The Carlist cell in $PROVINCENAME$ has been found! After a battle with authorities, the majority of the rebels have been either captured or executed. We have found good information in their base, including the names of many of their supporters throughout $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37716;The Christinos Prevail!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37716;The capital has been overrun, the pretender king driven into the provinces, and the original royal line descending from Ferdinand VII has been restored to the Spanish throne. Many liberals are breathing a sigh of relief, but reactionaries are furious. Already supporters of the pretender are seeking new allies in the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37717;Rise of the Christinos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37717;The supporters of the former royal line still exist, and we have begun to receive reports of a Christino cell having been established in one of our provinces. They are gaining a great deal of support among liberals in the province with their calls for an overthrow of the 'pretender' on the throne. The cell is well-hidden, and rooting them out will not be easy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37718;Christino Sympathies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37718;It seems that sympathies for the Christinos among the locals in $PROVINCENAME$ have been increasing. Reports have it that another rebel cell has been established, and that a campaign of resistance against Spanish authorities has begun.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37719;Christino Cell Discovered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37719;The Christino cell in $PROVINCENAME$ has been found! After a battle with authorities, the majority of the rebels have been either captured or executed. We have found good information in their base, including the names of many of their supporters throughout $PROVINCENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37720;The Glorious Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37720;The death of Leopoldo O'Donnell has eroded Queen Isabella's support, to the point where a movement to overthrow her has rapidly developed. A mutiny by naval officers in Cadiz has provided the spark for a widespread revolt against Isabella's rule. Her chief minister and generals have deserted her, and Isabella was forced to flee into exile. For the moment, Spain stands without a ruler, and the provisional government argues over what its next step should be. Some favor abandoning the monarchy altogether, but most feel a new king should be selected. Isabella's heir, Prince Alfonso, is thought by many to be too much under her influence. Other choices are the moderate Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern and the liberal Prince Amadeo of Savoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37721;The Spanish Succession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37721;With Queen Isabella II having been deposed by a revolt, the Spanish provisional government has been busy seeking a new monarch to assume the throne... and among the candidates considered was Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern. Our government objected strongly to the move, as this would spread Prussian influence to our southern border, and while this did convince Prince Leopold to turn down the throne it has not endeared us to the Prussians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37722;King Leopold of Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37722;With Queen Isabella II having been deposed by a revolt, the Spanish provisional government has been busy seeking a new monarch... and the candidate they have chosen is none other than Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern. A German prince on the Spanish throne is a direct threat to our nation's security. We must do something about this immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37725;King Leopold Assassinated!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37725;The Hohenzollern king of Spain, controversial since his ascension to the throne and constantly balked in the royal courts by moarchists advocating a return to the Bourbon line, was shot dead in his carriage shortly after arriving in Madrid following a country outing. The country is left in chaos and once again without a monarch on the throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37730;The Abdication of Amadeo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37730;King Amadeo, controversial since his ascension and constantly balked in the royal courts by moarchists advocating a return to the Bourbon line, has angrily declared Spain to be 'ungovernable' after the Hidalgo Affair forced him into conflict with the nation's military and has abdicated the throne. The country is left in chaos and once again without a monarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37735;A Return to Bourbon Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37735;The Spanish Republic has been contentious since its inception. After a series of failed governments, many Spaniards have come to favor a return to the stability of Bourbon rule. In a coup led by Brigadier General Martinez Campos, the Republican army has declared its alliegiance to Prince Alfonso-- son of the exiled Queen Isabella II-- and named him King of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37740;The Treaty of Paris, $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37740;We are losing the war with $FROMCOUNTRY$, and it's only a matter of time before we're forced to submit to a humiliating defeat. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has made it clear it considers our colonial holdings to be beyond our ability to control, and is willing to purchase them for a 'fair' price. Failure to submit to their demands will mean the war dragging on to its inevitable conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has signed the Treaty of Paris. Their colonial holdings are ours, for a price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37742;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37742;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sign the Treaty of Paris. The war continues!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37743;Carlist Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37743;The Carlists have been spreading their propaganda into neighboring $PROVINCENAME$, and reports have it that their lies are finding a ready audience among the locals. We can put a stop to their efforts, though not without being rather indiscriminate in our arrests and reprisals among $PROVINCENAME$'s poor. Still, radical measures may be called for in order to stop the Carlists from gaining headway here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37744;Christino Propaganda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37744;The Christinos have been spreading their propaganda into neighboring $PROVINCENAME$, and reports have it that their lies are finding a ready audience among the locals.

Still, radical measures may be called for in order to stop the Christinos from gaining headway here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37745;Moroccan Border Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37745;A heated dispute has arisen between the Moroccans and our government over the boundaries of our holdings in Melilla. Some believe the Moroccans are attempting to gain sympathy from the French, but we have it on good authority that there will be no aid coming for them. Now may be the time for us to exert some of our authority over this African upstart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME38505;Death of the Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC38505;The death of Sa'id bin Sultan Al-Busaid has left him with two sons, each of which has claimed Oman as their own to rule. The result of this struggle has brought in foreign mediation, with the resulting decree that the nation will be split into two sultanates: one in Zanzibar and one in Muscat, each ruled by one of Al-Basaid's sons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44122;Webster–Ashburton Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44122;We have concluded a treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, resolving several long-standing border disputes between our nations. In particular, the treaty has clearly established the border between Maine and the British colony of New Brunswick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44150;54-40 or Fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44150;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Oregon Country. The entire region west of the Rockies (called Columbia by the British) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. The British claim all the way south to the 42nd Parallel and the Americans north to the 54th Parallel. It's clearly a tense situation, and the specter of war with the British looms as politicians in the current election campaign are banging the drums of Manifest Destiny in order to gain support.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44151;The Columbia District;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44151;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. The British claim all the way south to the 42nd Parallel and the Americans north to the 54th Parallel. The situation is tense, and made more so by jingoistic American politicians calling for sovereignty over the entire continent. Even so, the American government has sent a delegation seeking a compromise in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44152;The Oregon Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44152;The British have agreed to a compromise, splitting the Oregon Country between us at the 49th Parallel. Any British lands held by us will be turned over to them, and vice-versa. Though some Americans are upset, many others are breathing a sigh of relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44153;Oregon Negotiations Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44153;The talks with the British have broken down, primarily due to the continuing calls by war-mongering politicians. Neither of our options now is very pleasant: either we abandon our claims to Oregon no matter what some might think, or we press ahead with the claims and brace for eventual war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44154;American Claims in Columbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44154;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. Recently the situation has been exacerbated by American politicians rattling their sabres over their idea of 'Manifest Destiny', and they have pressed their claim all the way north to the 54th Parallel. It will almost certainly mean war, and our only consideration should probably be whether we wish to pursue another costly war with the Americans in North America when our time could better be spent elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44155;Oregon Country is Ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44155;The British have elected to withdraw from Oregon and have signed a treaty to hand any American land over to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44303;Pacification of the Metis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44303;It has taken time to settle the grievances following the Riel Rebellion, but treaties with the various Metis groups throughout the North-West territories have managed to properly incorporate them into Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44305;Rebellions of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44305;Perhaps inspired by the American Revolution, colonists in both the Lower Canada and Upper Canada colonies have risen up in rebellion. They are frustrated by the lack of political reform, as well as the entrenched power held by the reactionary elites of the 'Family Compact', and agitators are demanding responsible government if not outright independence. The colonial government has moved to arrest the perpetrators as traitors to the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44306;Lord Durham's Report;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44306;Lord Durham has returned from his mission to investigate the causes of the rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada with recommendations to the British crown-- namely that the two colonies be united under a single responsible government through an Act of Union. He fears that, if we do not, we may be facing further rebellion just as was faced in America. Indeed, it is entirely possible the Canadian radicals could attract support from the Americans if they are not appeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44310;The Charlottetown Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44310;A gathering of governors from our Maritime colonies in North America has also been attended by governors from Canada. According to reports, they are attempting to organize a larger confederation of the colonies with an eye towards eventual self-government. We would like to see the North American colonies be more self-reliant, so it may be in our best interest to allow this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44315;The Canadian Dominion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44315;The colonial government of Canada has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see renewed rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44316;The Dominion of Quebec;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44316;The colonial government of Quebec has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see renewed rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44317;The Maritime Dominion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44317;The colonial governments of the Maritimes have officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colonies better able to protect themselves without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44318;The Dominion of British Columbia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44318;The colonial government of British Columbia has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44320;The Rupert's Land Act of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44320;A bill has been passing through the British Parliament which would see the entirety of Rupert's Land-- all North American colonial territory between British Columbia and Ontario-- being given offered to the Canadian dominion. Currently the land is administered by the Hudson's Bay Company, and thus the Canadian government would be required to purchase it. Should they choose to do so, it would strengthen our ally greatly and relieve our overextended colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44321;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has passed an act which would see the Canadian government offered control over all of Rupert's Land-- essentially all $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory in North America east of British Columbia. We would need to purchase the land from the Hudson's Bay Company at no small expense, though it would be one of the largest land purchases in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44322;The Rupert's Land Act Fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44322;A British act which would have seen us offered the rights to purchase all of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company has been defeated. Canadian dreams of uniting the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific have been dashed in one fell swoop! Citizens in $CAPITAL$ are outraged at this betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44325;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Asks To Join Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44325;Relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ are friendly, and thus the dream of a larger Canadian confederation has resurfaced. Delegates from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made the journey to $CAPITAL$ with the goal of negotiating terms of joining our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44339;The Northwest Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44339;The land north of the 60th parallel is inhospitable to settlers, but there is a growing concern that should the Canadian government not move to fully claim the territory another power will do so. It will take considerable political capital to convince the other world powers of Canadian dominion in the north, but many feel we must make the effort... and considering there are reports of gold in the Yukon it might be wise to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44351;The British Columbian Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44351;Representatives from British Columbia have met with Canadian delegates in $CAPITAL$ to discuss terms of their joining confederation. The only thing that appears to interest them is the building of a national railway linking the Pacific and the Atlantic. Without it, they say, the nation is too divided and they are more connected with other regions along the Pacific coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44355;First Stage of the CNR;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44355;The first stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Winnipeg to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the second stage, which will be considerably more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44356;Second Stage of the CNR;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44356;The second stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Calgary to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the last stage, which will be the longest and most difficult yet as it requires creating a pass through the Rocky Mountains themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44357;The CNR Completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44357;After a massive effort expended to create a pass through the Rocky Mountains, the Canadian National Railway has been completed! A single railway now links the Pacific coast to the Atlantic. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate the first locomotive being sent to make the complete journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44805;Antonio López de Santa Anna;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44805;A general and war hero of Mexican independence, Santa Anna was elected President in 1833. After deposing his liberal vice-president, Santa Anna abrogated the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with both church and military backing. Many Mexican states objected to this centralization of power, and with the rebellion of Tejas to the north the entire country seems to be in a state of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44810;Rebellion in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44810;Malcontents in $STATENAME$ have risen up in defiance of the government, demanding a return to democratic rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44815;Texas Recaptured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44815;The rebel state of Tejas has been recaptured. A glorious victory for Mexico, and a blow against the malcontents who seek to spread dissension and discord!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44820;Republic of the Rio Grande;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44820;Inspired by the success of the Tejas rebellion, liberal malcontents in the provinces along the Rio Grande have risen up and declared their independence from Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44821;The Yucatan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44821;Angered by the abrogation of the 1824 Constitution and the centralization of government power in Mexico City, liberals in the Yucatan have declared their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44822;Join the United Provinces?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44822;Eventually, the Mexican government will come after our country and seek to re-incorporate it into the federation. If we are to survive, joining the United Provinces of Central America may be our only hope. Shall we make the request?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44825;The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44825;With our capital under American control, it seems we have little choice but to negotiate. The Americans have offered us a deal: the normalization of relations, the forgiveness of our debt and the payment of a great deal of money... all in exchange for a cession of all the northern territories currently claimed by their country. If we refuse, it may mean many years more of war for us until these Americans get what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ceding all American-claimed territory to our control. For now, the relations between our two countries can return to normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44827;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44827;Despite having them over the figurative barrel, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused to capitulate to our demands. So much the worse for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44830;Execution of Emperor Maximilian;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44830;Emperor Maximilian has never enjoyed popular support in Mexico, and now that insurgents led by Benito Juárez have captured him it seems his reign has come to an end. Court-martialed and executed by a firing squad, the new republic was declared only days after his death. Benito Juárez has assumed the role of President of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44835;The Plan of Tuxtepec;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44835;Porfirio Díaz, General of Mexico and considered a hero by some, has overthrown the democratic government of Mexico in a military coup. Planned in secret with several military officers and announced in Oaxaca, it has disavowed the presidency of Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada and installed Diaz as a military-backed dictator.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME45102;La Trinitaria;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC45102;Juan Pablo Duarte has founded a secret society called 'La Trinitaria', seeking complete independence of Santo Domingo from Haiti and other foreign powers. Many Caribenos are calling the man a visionary, and his ideas are gaining great popularity in eastern Hispaniola.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46303;War of the Farrapos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46303;Porto Alegre is under Brazilian control once again. The gauchos, however, have promised to continue their rebellion against what they consider unfair rule from the throne. It may prove difficult in the coming years to keep the region calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46304;Solano's Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46304;The dictator of Paraguay, Solano Lopez, has turned his eye towards Brazilian lands to the southeast. Direct access to the Atlantic Ocean would be of great benefit to the country, rather than relying on Uruguayan permission to use the river-- permission which might not always be forthcoming, thanks to Brazilian interference. Perhaps it is time to flex Paraguay's muscle and establish an empire of our own?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46605;The Argentine Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46605;Unrest is stirring against the Rosas dictatorship in Argentina, with liberals demanding a constitution and a trasition to democratic rule. Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and asked us to support an uprising should Rosas refuse the liberal demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46610;The Constitutional Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46610;General Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has turned against the Rosas government and demanded that it submit to liberal demands for a new constitution. There are hints that neighboring governments might support Urquiza, and that should he rise up in rebellion against us they will intervene on his behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46611;The Argentine Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46611;With Rosas unable to defeat the Entre Rios rebellion, he has been forced to flee Argentina and General Urquiza has assumed temporary control of the government. Meeting with liberals in Santa Fe, they have drawn up a new constitution which has created an Argentine Republic. The Buenos Aires province is displeased and vows to resist,but the wind of change is clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME46612;General Urquiza Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC46612;The rebellion in Entre Rios has been put down, and both General Urquiza and his liberal supporters have been captured and executed. The Argentine states have submitted to the will of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49501;Reforming the Kalmar Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49501;Members of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government have approached us, suggesting that the Kalmar Union must be ressurrected. For the moment, this is simply an idea, a suggestion that the Scandinavian nations should work together towards an eventual union. If we disagree, it's possible that the idea dies here. If we don't, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might be mortally insulted. If Scandinavians are to take their rightful place in Europe, however, perhaps there is merit in their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA49501;A royal marriage cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB49501;We see little reason to join such a union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ proposal. It is now in our hands whether to let the Union die here and now, or force $FROMCOUNTRY$  to join us whether they like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA49502;Oh well, I guess that's over then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB49502;We'll see how they feel with an army in their capital...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49503;Form a Customs Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49503;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed the next logical step in our mutual cooperation: a customs union between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$, indeed all of Scandinavia, which would remove the restrictions on trade between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA49503;A customs union cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB49503;This is going too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49504;Form a Political Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has suggested a political union between their country and $COUNTRY$, arguing that this is the next logical step for Scandinavia's security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA49504;It seems like a logical argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTB49504;This is going too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49505;Norway Asks For Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49505;Your Norwegian subjects seek to establish their own independent kingdom. The other European powers support their independence, and will be upset if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49506;Norway Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49506;This time they are not asking nicely. Independence or war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49507;Finnish Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49507;Your Finnish subjects seek to form their own nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49508;Danish Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49508;Your Danish subjects wish to end our union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME49509;The Leadership of Kalmar;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC49509;As our power in Scandinavia wanes and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence grows, so does the focus of the union move to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME60121;Joining the Greater Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC60121;Since the revolution, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has awaited a contender who could unite $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$. Now that such a nation has arisen, many feel it is time to surrender our personal sovereignty towards the $UNION_ADJ$ cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90016;Archduke Ferdinand Assassinated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90016;One of the most prominent members of Austrian aristocracy has been murdered by a Serbian assassin, a member of a group of nationalists who seek to rejoin with the Serbian nation. There are definite suspicions that the Serbian government has been secretly helping these nationalists and is behind the event.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90017;The Hungarian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90017;With the recent unrest in Hungarian lands, the local Hungarian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90018;The Lombardy Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90018;With the recent unrest in Italian lands, the local government of the Lombardy province has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90019;The Croatian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90019;With the recent unrest in Croat lands, the local Croatian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90020;The Slovenian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90020;With the recent unrest in Slovene lands, the local Slovenian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90021;The Bohemian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90021;With the recent unrest in Czech lands, the local Bohemian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90022;The Slovakian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90022;With the recent unrest in Slovak lands, the local Slovakian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90025;Tunisian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90025;It has become increasingly obvious that the Tunisian government operates independently from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. We cannot continue to control them directly, and must either take measures to assert our dominance or allow them to seek their own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90026;The Young Ottomans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90026;A group of liberal intellectuals that were responsible for the reforms of the Kanûn-i Esâsî have begun stirring up resentment of the Ottoman autocracy. They demand to see the power of the throne reduced to that of a constitutional monarchy, though advisors note that giving into their demands will only anger reactionaries determined to see the Empire's traditions maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90027;Greece Demands Thessaly;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90027;The government of Greece sent a demand that the state of Thessaly be returned to their rightful control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90028;Serbia Sends Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90028;The government of Serbia sent a demand for Serbian lands to be returned to their rightful control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90029;Bulgarian Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90029;With the recent unrest in Bulgarian lands, the local Bulgarian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90030;Albanian Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90030;With the recent unrest in Albanian lands, the local Albanian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90031;Bosnian Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90031;With the recent unrest in Bosniak lands, the local Bosniak government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90032;Iraqi Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90032;With the recent unrest in Iraqi lands, the local Iraqi government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90033;Independence for Crete?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90033;With the recent unrest in Crete, the local government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90034;Union With Greece;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90034;The time has come to unite with our Greek brothers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90035;Montenegro Sends Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90035;The government of Montenegro sent a demand for their lands to be returned to their control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90036;Freedom in the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90036;The Ottomans continue their brutal oppression of Orthodox Christians in the Balkans. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been receiving calls for assistance from dissidents within the Empire, and the feeling among our own Orthodox citizens is that we should take a stand to help our brothers of the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90038;The Pact of Plombières;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90038;We have been approached by a Sardinian envoy, the Count of Cavour, who has made an interesting proposal: an alliance to make war against Austria, gaining Sardinia the Austrian-held provinces of Lombardy. In exchange, Sardinia would hand over Savoy and Nice to France. It is an interesting idea, and one that allows France to take a role that would not paint us as the aggressors. Shall we agree?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90040;The Sepoy Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90040;A mutiny by a group of sepoys in the service of the British East India company has ignited lingering resentment amongst our Indian subjects into open resistance against our rule. Should this grow out of hand, all of our holdings in British India could be in jeopardy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90039;$MONARCHTITLE$, the ambassador from Sardinia-Piedmont has approached us with the suggestion of a pan-Italian alliance to retake the lost northern lands from Austria. A dangerous proposition, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90041;Galician Slaughter;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90041;Polish peasants in Austrian-held Galicia have risen up and slaughtered wealthy landowners, leading to calls by nobility within the Free City of Krakow for a larger uprising. Many in Austria are seeing this as a reason to end Krakow's independence once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90050;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90051;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move. They believe their future lies with the German Confederation to the south, but the Duke of Augustenberg has a stronger claim to Schleswig than the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ King. Schleswig-Holstein must forge its own path, even if it means war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90052;Schleswig-Holstein Under Our Control;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90052;Now that order has been restored to Schleswig-Holstein, international pressure is mounting to uphold treaties regarding the region. Failure to restore nominal independence to the duchies and keep them united will result in tensions between $COUNTRY$ and other European powers, and possibly war with the German Confederation to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90053;The November Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support. If the new consitution is signed, Schleswig-Holstein will be officially divided. If it is not, the Danish people will almost certainly rise up against their new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90054;The Schleswig-Holstein Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90054;The arrogant German aristocrats in Holstein have declared they intend to pursue a future with the German Confederation to the south, and consider Schleswig an indivisible part of their territory. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ militants are angrily calling for the military to step in, though some fear this may lead to war with the Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90055;The question of Schleswig-Holstein's place within the German Confederation has now finally been resolved-- in our favor. This will have larger repercussions, as the free German states will see that $COUNTRY$ is the true leader of the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90056;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. This puts it in a unique position to assume leadership of the German Confederation as well as dominance over the North German states. We will need to take swift and decisive action if $COUNTRY$ is to maintain its position of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90057;Look to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90057;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. It's possible that aligning ourselves with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is far more in our best interest, as well as more likely to create a united Germany under North German dominance. We should reconsider our current allegiances.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90060;The Eastern Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire's hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90061;Planning for the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90062;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90062;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of $COUNTRY$ to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to carve up our nation, and an insult, but regardless we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90063;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90063;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to bolster the shaky Empire's hold over the Middle East and balk Russian 'aggression'. Either way, we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90064;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90064;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them. Still others feel we should not take part in this veiled attempt at dismembering a sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90065;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Keep the Empire Strong;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favored the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress's edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90066;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Stabilize the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90067;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90068;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consesus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability, though it is clear they are angered by the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defies the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decreed that it will not abide by the demands of the Congress. The Treaty, they say, is so much worthless paper, and they refuse to give up any of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90075;The Fate of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90076;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90077;Negotiations with the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90078;Egypt Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine-- something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90079;Egypt Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90080;The Egyptian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90085;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90086;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90086;We have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90087;The Fall of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90088;The Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control. Our advisors say that wresting control of the entire country is almost impossible, and that we should take the offer while we can and let the Egyptians go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90089;End of the Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now. All that remains is for us to decide whether to end hostilities with the Egyptians and return any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lands that we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90090;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90091;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90091;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If something isn't done it could develop into an alliance between Egypt and $FROMCOUNTRY$ that could lead to their intervention in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90092;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90092;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If we do not object now, that support could lead to their intervention in the war. That objection, however, could also be seen as aggression on our part and harm our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90093;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Withdrawal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90110;The Manifesto de Montecristi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90110;Jose Martí, a Cuban intellectual and radical who has spent a great deal of time organizing émigrés in the United States, has returned to the colony and declared the Manifesto de Monticristi, an exposition of the purposes and principles of the coming Cuban revolution. It seems the uprising has been in the planning for some time, and if the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government intends to remain in control of Cuba it could have a battle ahead of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90115;The Maine Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90115;To hell with Spain! Remember the Maine!\n\nA riot by Cuban Spanish loyalists recently broke out in Havana, leading to the destruction of the printing presses of four local newspapers which criticized the Spanish Army. The battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in response to fears expressed by the American consulate that Americans in Cuba might be endangered. Not long after arriving, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour. American newspapers have leapt on the event, painting pictures of Spanish atrocities which have whipped up the public into a rage. People are calling for war against Spain and intervention in Cuba.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90120;The Propaganda Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90120;Three Filipino priests have been executed in the Manila, charged with subversion. While the executions are said to have been just, they are now considered martyrs by the Filipino people and have inspired the creation of a literary and organization known as 'the Propaganda Movement'. The organization consists of Filipino émigrés in Spain, primarily liberals and students, who are attempting to increase awareness of the needs of the Phillipines and foster better relations between Spain and its colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90125;The Katipunan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90125;We have received reports from colonial officers in Manila regarding rumors of a secret organization called the 'Katipunan'. Formed by anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Filipinos, they reportedly seek complete independence for the Phillipines. It's possible that limited home rule might mollify some of these revolutionaries, but nothing short of freedom will satisfy them for long. Tracking them down among sympathetic locals may prove difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90130;With the recent unrest in Cuba, the prospect of the Spanish government possibly selling the island to the United States has arisen. Should we attempt to pursue negotiations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90132;The Spanish Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90132;After some negotiation, conducted in secret, the Spanish have finally refused to sell Cuba. More than one member of the government has been angered by this, seeing the island as naturally falling into the American sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90133;Cuba is Ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90133;With no small amount of fanfare, Spain has agreed to the sale of Cuba to the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90135;The Grito de Lares;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90135;With conditions in our Puerto Rican colony so poor, the notion of independence has begun to spread among the local Caribenos. Reports from the colonial governor state a revolt has begun in the town of Lares, one that may be difficult to put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90140;The Intentona de Yauco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90140;We have received reports of an independence movement having been formed in Puerto Rico, with an uprising having been organized in the town of Yauco. While the movement doesn't yet have a great deal of support among local conservatives, many of whom are hoping there is still a chance to achieve independence from $COUNTRY$ through peaceful means, it's possible that their efforts could spread if we don't put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95026;Liberian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95026;The Liberian colony was founded as a homeland for freed American slaves by the American Colonization Society. Now that Liberia is considered a financial drain on its resources, the ACS is urging Liberia to proclaim idependence and find its own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95076;The January Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95076;A spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army has quickly erupted into a widespread insurrection, supported by high-ranking Polish and Lithuanian officers and politicians. The eyes of all of Europe are upon us, and if we deal with the insurgents too harshly it may hurt our relations with European powers. If we do not, however, the uprising may spread even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95085;The Finnish Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95085;With the recent unrest in Finnish lands, the local Finland government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95095;Norwegian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95095;The Norwegian government has formally requested to be granted full independence from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95200;Turkmen Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95200;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Turkmen peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a Turkmenian state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95201;Kazakh Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95201;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Kazakh peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a Kazakh state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95205;Uzbek Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95205;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Uzbek peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a single Uzbek state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95206;Reclaiming Uzbek Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95206;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are clamoring for all Uzebeks to be united under our flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95210;Tajik Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95210;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Tajik peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a Tajik state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95215;Kyrgyz Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95215;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Kyrgyz peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a modern Kyrgyz state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95216;Reclaiming Kyrgyz Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95216;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are clamoring for all Kyrgyz to be united under our flag.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95250;The White Rajah;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95250;Brunei's control over the southern regions has only ever been nominal, and the region has been self-governed under the Sultan of Sarawak. During a recent crisis, an Englishman by the name of James Brooke provided the Sultan invaluable assistance in restoring order, and has been bestowed with the title of governor. This 'White Rajah' is now effectively the ruler, and is seeking alliance with Brunei. We must either recognize the independence of an area we only barely controlled, or seek to assert our authority and perhaps anger the English in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95251;The Dutch East Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95251;The Dutch East India Company has been slowly spreading its influence within the East Indies, and is urging our government to establish protectorates over the remaining sultanates on the islands. Indeed, they have been stirring up trouble in the region. Many within our government feel that if the Netherlands is to remain a power to be reckoned with, it must expand its colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95255;Indonesian Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95255;The call has been sent out for the peoples of the East Indies to unify under a common banner, for protection against foreign imperialism and to usher in a new world power to make the Europeans tremble. The people are cheering in the streets of $CAPITAL$ at the welcome news. Will $COUNTRY$ do its part?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95260;The Disunited States;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95260;With the end of the democratic government of the United States, there is a growing feeling among many Americans that the principles upon which the country were founded no longer apply. Talk of secession is frequent, if quiet," and as unrest begins to grow it's become increasingly more possible that liberal-minded states will attempt to pull out of the Union. If they do, we must be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95261;The Sons of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95261;A group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty has secretly formed in $PROVINCENAME$, advocating either the overthrow of the totalitarian American regime or the secession of $STATENAME$ from the Union. American law-enforcement is doing its best to hunt down these traitors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95262;The Union Reborn!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95262;With the totalitarian regime ended, Americans have taken to the streets to celebrate their regained liberties. Flags of the Sons of Liberty are in evidence everywhere. Let us hope this new era holds, and that the Union has not already been sundered beyond repair.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95265;Congress of $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95265;A large group of secessionists have gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, among their numbers law-makers and politicians as well as angry liberals and members of the so-called Sons of Liberty. A vote was passed, declaring the United States of America dead and demanding $STATENAME$ secede from the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95286;Congress of New England;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95286;A large group of secessionists have gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, among their numbers law-makers and politicians as well as angry liberals and members of the so-called Sons of Liberty. A vote was passed, declaring the United States of America dead and demanding the states that form New England be allowed to secede from the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95310;The New Southern Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95311;The Free States of America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95315;Join the Canadian Confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95315;With things in $COUNTRY$ so difficult, some citizens have brought up the possibility of joining the Confederation of Canada. It is a land of freedom, and together we will be more powerful than we are separately. Shall we approach their government?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95316;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Asks to Join Canada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95316;A delegate from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has quietly approached the Canadian government, asking for the former American state to be admitted to Confederation. While this may seem like a good idea, the Americans may see us as opportunists for accepting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95510;Rebellion in Eritrea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95510;With the Sudan in chaos, the Ethiopians have taken advantage of the situation to regain control over the Eritrean coastlands. Though we may yet regain control over the Sudan, we should consider whether the Eritreans must be punished for this trespass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95512;Zemene Mesafint;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95512;The 'Age of Princes' is upon us. The rulers of Ethiopia must struggle to unite the land under a single Emperor-- and now it is $COUNTRY$'s time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96100;The Arab Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96100;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Mashriqi, fueled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Our governors in the region are understandably nervous, and report that we can expect major rebellions in the coming years unless we are very careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96101;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Self-Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96101;We have been granted self-rule by our $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96102;The Arab Revolt has begun, and many people in $CAPITAL$ are flying the revolt flag. They are demanding freedom from foreigner rule, and we will have difficulty keeping them under control... provided that's what we wish to do, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96105;The Bedouin Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96105;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Bedouin, fueled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Our governors in the region are understandably nervous, and report that we can expect major rebellions in the coming years unless we are very careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96106;Arab Uprising in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96106;We have received word of an uprising that has occurred in $PROVINCENAME$. A group of Mashriqi tribesman attacked the local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison, and were quickly put down. The $PROVINCENAME$ governor made a point of displaying their bodies, hoping that would discourage others from following suit. It hasn't. Arab outrage has been fanned throughout $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96107;Bedouin Uprising in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96107;We have received word of an uprising that has occurred in $PROVINCENAME$. A group of Bedouin tribesman attacked the local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison, and were quickly put down.

EVTNAME96110;The House of Saud Returns;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96110;Abdul-Aziz, scion of the House of Saud, has returned from exile in Kuwait. Not only that, the man has managed to forge an alliance with the southern Bedouin tribes and retaken Riyadh. We must deal with ibn Saud quickly, lest he retake even more land and reverse our earlier victory over his house.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96115;The Rule of Hedjaz;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96115;We have always been torn between our loyalty to Egypt and to the Ottoman Empire. The time has come to decide between them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96120;The House of Rashid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96120;The House of Saud will never unite Arabia so long as the Emirate of Ha'il stands on our northern border. We must marshal our force and bring them to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96121;The House of Saud;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96121;The House of Rashid will never unite Arabia so long as the Emirate of Nejd stands on our southern border. We must marshal our force and bring them to their knees.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96165;Italian Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96165;The Italians have managed to unify at long last, threatening $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the region. We will have to decide whether it is in our best interests to object or to make friends with the new rulers. What has been done cannot now be undone, after all, and a united Italy could be a formidable enemy or a powerful $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME96170;Il Risorgimento;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC96170;$COUNTRY$ has become the center of Italian nationalism, its people calling out for unification. Italian flags are flying in the streets of $CAPITAL$, and we must decide if we wish to support this call and bring all of Italy peacefully under our banner. If we refuse, our people will be upset... and it's unlikely the opportunity will arise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97000;The Revolution of Maria de Fonte;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97000;A growing dissatisfaction with the ruling government among Portugal's poor has grown into rebellion, spurred on by popular discontent with the prohibition against burials inside churches. The instigator of the initial riots is a woman by the name of Maria, and her nickname has come to be used to represent the rebellion-- which has a large contingent of peasant women among its supporters -- and which has been co-opted by revolutionaries in emulation of the rebellions elsewhere in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97001;Peasant Revolt in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97001;The Maria de Fonte rebellion has spread to $PROVINCENAME$, with the lower classes rising up in opposition to the ruling government. Many are calling for the government's resignation, and there are signs that Queen Maria II may engineer a coup to restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97002;End of the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97002;Portuguese forces have managed to restore order in the countryside, and the peasantry have been brought back under control. The danger of a royal coup has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97003;The Emboscada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97003;Spurred on by the spreading revolts in Portugal, Queen Maria II has suspended the constitution and installed a reactionary government presided over by João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha. This has served to spur on the country's liberals to outrage, and begun talk of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97006;The Occupation of Angola;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97006;Our forces are slowly pacifying the Angolan countryside. If we are fortunate, we will one day be able to connect our African colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97007;The Occupation of Mozambique;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97007;Our forces are slowly pacifying the Mozambiquan countryside. If we are fortunate, we will one day be able to connect our African colonies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97010;The Portuguese Colonies;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97010;We have received an ultimatum from $FROMCOUNTRY$: surrender our colonies between Angola and Mozambique or suffer the consequences. The Portuguese people feel this is an incredible betrayal by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$. They have traditionally been our ally, and now they are trying to bully our rightful colonial holdings out of us? It cannot be borne!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97011;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97011;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to our terms-- though they are unhappy about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97012;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97012;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused our ultimatum, and all but dared $COUNTRY$ to take their colonies from them-- if we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97015;Regicide of King Carlos I;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97015;Upon returning to Lisbon from a brief trip abroad, King Carlos I and the royal family had their carriage fired upon by republican activists as they passed through the Terreiro do Paço. Three of the bullets struck and killed the King, while another fatally wounded the heir to the throne, Luis Filipe. During the turmoil, the police killed the assassins... but the King and the royal heir were not saved and were pronounced dead at the Naval Arsenal soon afterwards. Manuel, the king's youngest son, has been quickly acclaimed as the new King of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97020;The Republican Coup D'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97020;With the monarchy already weakened by the death of King Carlos, republican opponents have been able to gather considerable support in the capital. Members of the Carbonária, republican youth, and elements of the army have instigated a coup d'état in the palace. The young King Manuel and his family have reportedly escaped for exile to England, and only days later a new Portuguese Republic has been declared in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97050;The Peru-Bolivian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97050;The confederation of Peru, South Peru and Bolivia represents a threat to our interests. If the confederation is given time to solidify, they could easily become a new powerhouse in South America-- and one that is no friend to $COUNTRY$. Thankfully there are signs that the confederation is unstable: the Peruvians chafe at the Bolivian leadership, and given enough incentive they might withdraw. If we act now, we might be able to stir our people against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97055;End of the Confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97055;With the recent losses suffered by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces, confidence in the confederation has eroded. If we attempt to keep it together, we must do so by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97060;The Uruguayan Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97060;Brazil has traditionally held the right to intervene in Uruguayan internal affairs as it sees fit, but in recent months the conservative Blanco government has proven to be increasingly intransigent. The rebel leader of the liberal Colorados, Venancio Flores, has approached us with the offer of an alliance: place him in power and Brazil has a firm ally in Uruguay once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97061;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97061;After several recent political conflicts with Brazil, they have sent an ultimatum: place the rebel leader of the Colorados in charge of the government or there will be war. There are many in the government who feel that Brazil cannot be serious. Uruguay is no threat, and they would risk angering the Platine nations with an invasion? This insulting ultimatum should be refused, according to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97062;Uruguay Rejects the Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97062;The Uruguayan government has rejected our demands. Perhaps they underestimate our willingness to see this matter to a swift end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97065;We Must Submit;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97065;We have no choice but to submit to the Brazilian demands. The Colorados are victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97066;The Blancos Have Surrendered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97066;The government of Uruguay has given in to our demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97070;La Carta de la Esclavitud;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97070;General Juan José Flores, the president of the republic and considered by many to be its founder, has responded to his falling popularity by engaging in voting irregularities and seeking to annul the 1835 constitution in order to remain in power. This new constitution, nicknamed the 'Carta de la Esclavitud' (or the 'letter of slavery') would anger a great number of the country's liberal populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97075;The Era of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97075;Gabriel García Moreno, called the father of Ecuadorian conservatism, has risen to power during a time of crisis. To some, he is exactly what the country needs to see it through these troubled times. To others he is a tyrant. In either case, Moreno now rules Ecuador with an iron fist.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97076;Settling Tarauaca;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97076;The jungles of Tarauaca lie in the heart of the Amazon, and rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$. Currently there are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ settlers eager for the opportunity to settle the region and have asked for the funds to assist them, though advisors say this may cause problems with neighboring states who also claim the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97080;Occupation of Araucania;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC97100;A dispute between local $PROVINCECULTURE$ leaders and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials in $PROVINCENAME$ has exploded into a riot, and the violence quickly spread throughout $STATENAME$. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ army is stamping out the rebellion as best it can, but fears persist that this could develop into a much larger problem if it continues.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97105;Rebellion Agaist Foreign Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97105;A dispute between $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrats and a foreign governor has exploded into a riots in $CAPITAL$. Many $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed from the yoke of its oppressor, and are ready to rise up and fight against the foreign armies that are sure to come. The idea that $COUNTRY$ may become a battleground pleases few, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97106;Control of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ India;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97106;One of the Indian Princely States has declared itself free of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. As Queen Victoria is the Empress of India, it seems only fitting that $COUNTRY$ control the entire sub-continent. Letting one of the Princely States go, after all, will only encourage the others to do the same... and hurts our international prestige at the same time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97107;Submission to the British;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97107;The British have demanded we once again submit to their rule as a Princely State. It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97110;The Stirrings of Indian Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97110;The people of India are diverse, consisting of numerous cultures and languages throughout the sub-continent. Seldom has there been any serious credence given to the idea of a single union crossing all cultural boundaries, save by force of arms. This has recently changed, with Indian nationalists in $COUNTRY$ calling for a true union-- one powerful enough to resist all imperialist efforts to conquer it. Surprisingly, their calls have received a great deal of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Seldom has there been any serious credence given to the idea of a single union crossing all cultural boundaries, save by force of arms. This has recently changed, with nationalists in $FROMCOUNTRY$ calling for a true India-- one united and powerful enough to resist all imperialist efforts to conquer it. Surprisingly, their calls have received a great deal of attention in $COUNTRY$ and this unified nationalism has been rapidly spreading.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97115;Death of the Maharajah;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97115;With the death of Ranjit Singh, a vacany has been left in the leadership of the Sikh Empire which will not be easily filled. The Maharajah's heir died suspiciously within months, as did the heir to follow, all due to infighting among the princes and the Panjabi nobility struggling to maintain power. Many fear this weakness will surely bring the British down upon the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97116;With the death of Ranjit Singh, a vacany has been left in the leadership of the Sikh Empire which will not be easily filled. The Maharajah's heir died suspiciously within months, as did the heir to follow, all due to infighting among the princes and the Panjabi nobility struggling to maintain power. As Sikhs pour into the British frontier, it seems we are inevitably drawn into the conflict-- and there are some who believe that now might be the perfect time to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97150;The Talambó Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97150;An alarming incident has occurred at the Talambó hacienda in Ica. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who has subsequently demanded the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Considering it was not long ago that $COUNTRY$ fought for its independence from Spain, submitting to such an indignity would go over less than well with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97151;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. They have done so, but some advisors bring up a possibility: if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is this fearful of Spanish power, perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over our lost Spanish colonies? Cutting $FROMCOUNTRY$ down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97152;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility. Perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over $FROMCOUNTRY$? Cutting them down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97153;The Spanish Royal Commissary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97155;Submitting to Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97155;We have been overrun by Spain, and now have no choice but to surrender our sovereignty to our former colonial overlords. It is a bitter day.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97156;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Submits;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose. Some might wonder if it's worthwhile for Spain to involve itself in South American affairs, particularly since they will ultimately try to rebel out from under us. Perhaps we have proven our point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97160;The Return of the Imperialists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are rightfully worried at what this means, and there are calls for us to take a stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97161;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Protests;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97161;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has issued a protest to our involvement in South America, telling us in no uncertain terms that we are not welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97165;Appeal to America?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97165;The United States claims it intends to protect the New World from encroachment from imperial powers in Europe. Now that Spain has made its imperialist intentions evident, perhaps it is time we put the so-called Monroe Doctrine to the test?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97166;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Requests Aid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe -- such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97170;The Mahdist Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97170;A Sudanese religious leader by the name of Muhammad Ahmad has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one') and begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism-- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97171;Mahdists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The religious leader's jihad against foreigners has sparked a local rebellion, one that the authorities have had a difficult time putting down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97500;Sovereign Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97501;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Our Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97502;French Escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places-- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97505;French Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97507;The War is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet-- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current wargoals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97510;The Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail). Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97515;Romanian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our indpendence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97517;The Russians Have Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97517;We have received word from the Russian government: they have agreed to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97518;The Russians Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97518;We have received word from the Russian government: they have refused to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97525;The cursed Romanians have coaxed the Russians into declaring war on us in support of their independence. We cannot let this stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97526;The Romanians have foolishly declared them independence. We must take action at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97550;The Federal Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97550;The Federal Republic of Central America has been chaotic since its inception. Liberals who had high hopes for the union are in constant battle with conservatives, in particular the clergy and wealthy landowners, and there is a general fear of domination by Guatemala. At this point, the struggle to maintain the union seems like an almost impossible one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97551;Costa Rica Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97551;With rebels in Nicaragua having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in southern Costa Rica. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in San Jose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97552;Nicaragua Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97552;With rebels in Honduras having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in Nicaragua. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in Managua.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97553;Order Restored in El Salvador;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97553;The government has managed to restore order in the El Salvador region. Officials in San Salvador have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97554;Order Restored in Honduras;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97554;The government has managed to restore order in the Honduras region. Officials in Comayagua have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97555;Order Restored in Nicaragua;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97555;The government has managed to restore order in the Nicaragua region. Officials in Managua have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97556;Order Restored in Costa Rica;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97556;The government has managed to restore order in the Costa Rica region. Officials in San Jose have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97560;End of the Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97560;The Federal Republic of Central America is rapidly disintegrating. Members of the government have met in $CAPITAL$ to discuss whether the union should be officially dissolved and the state of Guatemala declared, or whether we should fight to preserve what we have. Some consider that to be an impossible task, though liberals argue that we should not allow conservatives doom the region to a future of division and internal squabbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97561;Rebels in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$. Without the forces to oppose them, there is little we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97600;Sakoku;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97601;Rangaku;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima. Despite the enforced isolation of the nation, this policy of learning allowed western influences to spread-- particularly in the southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97605;Kurofune;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97606;Commodore Perry Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97606;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with a treaty in hand: we have gained numerous trade concessions, but more importantly we have cracked open the shield that is Japan's policy of isolation. This is a great coup for American diplomacy and influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97607;The Japanese Are Defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97607;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with unfortunate news: they have chosen to defy his ultimatum and thumb their collective noses at our government. Should we back down now, it will be a great blow to our prestige and our influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97608;Japanese Surrender?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97608;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of western armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated foreigners terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97609;The Japanese Have Surrendered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97609;We have formally concluded a treaty with the Japanese which will see our influence restored, and our demands for their ports to be opened to our ships to be met. Additionally, an indemnity will be placed upon their government to make up for the expense of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97610;The Japanese Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97610;Despite the overwhelming odds against them, the Japanese have refused our generous offer of surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97615;Sonno Joi;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97615;'Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!'\n\nThis is the slogan chanted by neo-confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa shogunate's opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen but also against the shogunate itself. Each incident chips away at Tokugawa control over the daimyo and erodes relations with the western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97616;$PROVINCENAME$ Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97616;There has been an incident in $PROVINCENAME$ where samurai, acting under the political slogan of 'Sonno Joi', have committed violence against foreigners conducting business in $STATENAME$. The incident has affected the Tokugawa shogunate's relations with foreign powers, as well as incited locals into riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97617;Order to Expel the Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97617;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, is a challenge to the shogunate's power, and may serve to further incite rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97618;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, and is a challenge to the shogunate's power. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan must decide whether it supports the Emperor's edict or quietly opposes it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97620;The Death of Iesada;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi-- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97621;Tokugawa Yoshinobu is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97623;Tokugawa Iemochi is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama. It is becoming increasingly clear that a larger change is necessary. Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97624;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the fudai daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the outsider tozama will have their influence in the bakufu kept to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97625;Sakuradamon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97625;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point. Many are urging that a policy of Kobu Gattai-- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court-- may be required.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97626;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, and thus the bakufu has begun a compromise policy of Kobu Gattai-- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court. Some are seeing this as a sign of further weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97627;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, yet the shogunate refuses to compromise with the imperial court. Many are certain this will only speed up the coming conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97630;The Death of Emperor Komei;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97630;There are some who believe that Emperor Komei was assassinated-- delivered a handkerchief laced with smallpox, perhaps by radicals who fear the possibility of compromise between the bakufu and the imperial court. No matter the truth, the death of the Emperor has placed the young Emperor Meiji upon the imperial throne and eliminated any chance of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97635;Opposition to the Bakufu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97635;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. Officials within the bakufu are urging that we seek allies among either the outsider tozama or the traditional fudai, to strengthen the shogunate's position. Approaching one means angering the other, of course, but it appears we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97636;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. We have received word that the shogunate has consulted with the outsider tozama, perhaps seeking new allies. If so, this compounds injury with insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We have received word that the shogunate has consulted with the fudai daimyo, perhaps seeking new allies. This is hardly unexpected, though the tozama agree this makes it clear that the shogunate is not the future of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97640;The Meiji Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97640;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have seized control of the palace at Kyoto and declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over Japan. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ must make a decision: do we throw in our support with the imperial court, or do we uphold our duty and support the shogun?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have seized control of the palace at Kyoto and declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over Japan. Word has it they have recruited fellow daimyo to stand with them in this traitorous war. We must issue a call to our allies and move at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97645;We Are Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97645;The Edo palace has been occupied, and our loyal daimyo are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Emperor his victory. There is a place for the Tokugawa within the new order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97646;The Meiji Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97646;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan forces have marched triumphantly into Edo, and the Tokugawa shogunate has agreed to a permanent peace. For the first time since before the Sengoku, the Imperial Court now rules Japan once again. Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97647;Emperor Meiji has been restored to rule over Japan. An imperial messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our willing allegiance to the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97648;A New Capital in the East?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97648;While Kyoto has long been the capital of Japan, and home to the Imperial Court, the city of Edo has become the de facto capital-- for centuries it has been the center of shogunate power, as well as a cultural and administrative center. The Emperor will need to decide whether the court should move to Edo and create a new capital... or remain in Kyoto and revitalize it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97650;We Are Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97650;The Imperial palace at Kyoto has been occupied, and our daimyo allies are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Shogun his victory. If we are fortunate, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan will not be wiped out by this unfortunate turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97651;Tokugawa Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97651;Tokugawa clan forces have marched triumphantly into Kyoto, and the traitor daimyos have agreed to a permanent peace. The Bakumatsu has ended with the shogunate in control once again-- victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97652;The Tokugawa shogunate has once again asserted control over Japan. A bakufu messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our submission to direct rule from Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97605;More 'black ships' have appeared off our shores, these ones commanded by an American named Commodore Matthew Perry. The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku-- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97660;The Korean Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97660;Many advisors within the government have stated that Korea presents a problem for Japan's security, and a recent rebellion in Korea shows how vulnerable they are. An invasion of the islands from the Korean mainland is a definite possibility, and in order to protect ourselves we should consider an invasion to set up a Korean protectorate. This will, of course, cause friction with the Chinese-- but why should we allow that to stand in the way of our protection? Many consider the Chinese themselves to be a severe threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97665;The Satsuma Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion. Led by one of the most prestigious samurai leaders of the former Satsuma Domain, Saigo Takamori, the rebellion has attracted a large number of followers and will be a severe challenge for the Japanese government to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97670;The Northern Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97670;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings on Hokkaido, and we must seek to claim these places before the Russians do so first.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98100;The Ladder Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98100;The treatment of slaves in Cuba has become increasingly harsh after recent unrest, culminating in the so-called 'Ladder Conspiracy' which relates to a method of torture involving tying a slave to a ladder and whipping them until they confess or die. Reformists in the colony have been calling for a change in Spanish policy and an end to the slave trade there. Failure to do so could result in more uprisings, but bowing to such pressure could have serious repercussions back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98105;The Cry of Yara;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98105;Cuban sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes has issued the 'Grito de Yara', the 'Cry of Yara', declaring Cuban independence from $COUNTRY$ and freedom for his slaves. The man has many followers, and his call has spread rapidly throughout the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98200;The Great Boer Trek;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with British rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the northeast, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the British government is concerned, the Boers are British subjects... no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98205;Invasion of the Laagers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from British rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98206;The Battle of Blood River;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony-- with the only question remaining whether the British will recognize their independence or continue to treat them as subjects of the crown. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98207;The Natalia Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are British subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98210;British Rule of Natal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are once again chafing under British rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they have not escaped the British crown. There have been several altercations with British military foces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way-- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98211;Natalian Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, the British crown has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence. Finally we will control our own destiny, away from the British now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98212;The Annexation of Natalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, we have received a demand from the British government that Natalia be annexed into the Cape Colony. For all our struggles to leave the British behind, they yet follow us and refuse to allow us independence! So now we are faced with a choice: submit and move on, to find a place beyond their reach once more, or defy them and risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98213;The Boers Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98213;We have received word from the Natalian government defying our annexation. Now we must either go to war or stand down in humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98215;The Orange River Sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98215;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Basotho. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Orange River valley and established a new colony-- one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98216;The Boers Overtake the Orange Valley;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98216;We have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Orange Valley and declared it their own. This is an outrage... yet what can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98220;The Transvaal Sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98220;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Ndebele. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Transvaal and established a new colony-- one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98221;The Boers Overtake the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98221;We have endured the presence of the Boers, colonists who resent the British and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Transvaal and declared it their own. This is an outrage... yet what can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98225;The Boer Exodus;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98225;With 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Boers are eager to leave $PROVINCENAME$ behind and travel to either the Transvaal or the Oranje Free State where they feel they will be free to pursue their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98230;Sand River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98230;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial authorities have met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to determine the requirements for our independence. They wish to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ remain strong, and would see us abandon any laws allowing slavery or the 'unethical' treatment of foreigners working in our territory ('uitlanders', as they are called). While our independence is a foregone conclusion, we must decide just how much we abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98231;Orange River Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98235;Migrants have been moving in large numbers through our African colonies on their way to the newly incorporated town of 'Johannesburg', on the edge of the Witwatersrand mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place. The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders and friction between our governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98236;Kimberley Goldrush;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98236;Gold has been discovered in the Kimberley province, leading to claims from both the Transvaal and Oranje governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Kimberley being awarded to the griquas-- who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Boer and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98240;The South African Union ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98240;The time has come to consider joining the South African union. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98241;Appeal From $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98241;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98245;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98246;The Anglo-Boer War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98246;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98255;Conflict with the Xhosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of British farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98256;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98260;Walvis Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98260;Other European nations are eyeing the region of Namaqualand, directly to the north of our holdings in the Cape Colony. To forestall their ambitions, it has been recommended that we establish an enclave at Walvis Bay and incorporate it into our southern colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98261;The Northern Cape Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98261;Many British settlers are pushing north of the Cape Colony into areas only tenuously claimed by our government. We should consider increasing our presence in the region and establishing greater colonial government, before another country comes and claims it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316081;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316081;A drunken riot by a large group of British sailors ashore at Kowloon has resulted in the death of a local man. By rights, the sailors should be tried and executed by the Qing magistrate. The British, however, have demanded extraterritoriality-- meaning their citizens would be tried by British judges. This will inevitably lead to their release and the anger of our citizens, but demanding these mens' executions could lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131709;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131709;An incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qing government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge-- the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse. Our prestige as an Empire to be reckoned with is being threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131710;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131710;In a display of diplomatic force, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have forced $COUNTRY$ to sign a treaty with them, forcing numerous trade as well as territory concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131711;The Simla Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131711;British diplomats have approached the Tibet government, hoping to broker a peaceful arrangement between Tibet and China now that Tibet is independent. No doubt they intend to gain influence and territory in our nation, as well as an ally against Chinese aggression,, but the prospect of war should the negotiations fail seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131712;British diplomats have approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, hoping to broker a peaceful arrangement between Tibet and $COUNTRY$ now that Tibet is independent. No doubt they intend to gain influence and territory in Tibet, as well as an ally against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aggression,, but the prospect of war should the negotiations fail seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131713;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131713;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have agreed to the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have improved as a result-- not to mention our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131714;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131714;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have cooled as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131715;The New Army;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131715;Our efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces. The generals in charge of these forces, 'warlords' as some call them, have been gaining a great deal of power. They are part of the Beiyang Army, but fight amongst themselves... And, far worse, are critical of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We will need to watch these generals carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131720;Spread of Anhui Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131720;Warlord influence has begun to spread into $STATENAME$. These generals are still loyal to $COUNTRY$, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that they are taking control of a significant portion of the country. Officials in $CAPITAL$ are alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131721;Spread of Guangdong Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131722;Spread of Guangxi Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131723;Spread of Hunan Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131724;Spread of Fengtian Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131725;Spread of Ma Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131726;Spread of Yunnan Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131727;Spread of Shanxi Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131728;Spread of Sichuan Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131729;Spread of Xinjiang Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131730;The Warlord Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131730;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their indepedence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China's destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131735;The Struggle for China;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131735;Now that we are free, we must choose where we stand in the ensuing struggle for the nation's destiny: either side with the Kuomintang and fight for domination of the republic or side with the Beiyang and fight for domination of a united China. Alternatively, we can declare our neutrality in the conflict and let the chips fall where they may.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131736;The Guominjun Clique;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131736;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general by the name of Feng Yuxiang has betrayed his superiors and broken off from the Beiyang armies. He and his supporters have taken the territory under their control and formed a new clique, swearing to topple the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131740;Leader of the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131740;The leaders of the Kuomintang are preparing for their drive on Beijing, and $COUNTRY$ is expected to answer the call. Either we side with Nationalist China now, or we must abandon the Kuomintang cause and seek our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has answered the call, and will unite their forces with ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131742;The War of Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131742;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are crying out for the nation to once again unify. We must gather our strength and strike out at those who would divide China, leaving it weak for foreigners to prey upon. Already the banners are in the streets, and $COUNTRY$'s generals are saying now is the time to launch an offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131743;War with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131743;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ army is massing on our mutual border, ready to make a massive offensive into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. It seems a war is upon us, whether we like it or not: either they destroy us or we destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131745;Chinese Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131745;The call has come from the capital: the era of warlords is over, and all the Chinese peoples must unite under a single flag. This means $COUNTRY$ must either submit to Beijing's rule or face more war against a strong and unified foe. Your generals stand ready to receive your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME131746;The Island of Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC131746;Now that we own the island of Formosa, the local Min population has begun to organize itself-- presumably towards the end of breaking away from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160001;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160001;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have finally risen in rebellion against Imperial rule. A peasant army has been organized by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui, followers of Hong Xiuquan, and have actually managed to defeat the Imperial garrisons and drive out the local governors. These Christians are driven to topple the Qing Dynasty and led by a madman... we must act quickly, before this rebellion succeeds and proves to the rest of China that the Mandate of Heaven no longer rests with the Manchu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160002;Taiping Rebellion Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160002;We have crushed the 'Heavenly Kingdom', and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160003;Taiping Rebellion Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the 'Heavenly Kingdom', the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army. There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Heavenly Kingdom must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160007:The War Against the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160007;The truce with the Qing Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Taiping Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160501;Missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160501;Christian missionaries are stirring up trouble in southern China, handing out pamphlets in an effort to gain converts. This would not be so objectionable were the pamphlet not also preaching sedition against the Qing Dynasty. The fact that so many in $PROVINCENAME$ are willing to listen to these fools is worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160502;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160502;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $PROVINCENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME162503;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC162503;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have infested yet another province. According to officials in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of Hong Xiuquan have been spotted and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164503;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164503;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164504;Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164505;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164505;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller has taken to walking the Southlands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164599;The Xinhai Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164599;The forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Emperor. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections. Army leaders, however, have threatened to oppose the Kuomintang and demanded the republic be under strict Beiyang control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164600;The Tongmenghui;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164600;Revolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or 'Chinese United League'. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisifed to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What's more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164601;Revolutionary Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164601;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$. The incident appears to have begun in $PROVINCENAME$, after a demonstration by local workers turned violent. Though authorities have already moved in, the damage is done. What remains is to determine how we react to this outrageous provocation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1605020;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1605020;After a period of self-enforced isolation, Hong Xiuquan has died-- some say of poison, others of illness. Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qing dynasty. Others say that $COUNTRY$ must become a republic, in emulation of western powers. Whether $COUNTRY$ is ready for such a change is difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1605021;Retreat to Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1605021;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa. The suggestion among what little remains of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taibei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800079;$COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Summit of $YEAR$ a Disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800079;The summit in $CAPITAL$ went very poorly. There are too many issues between our nations, and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats left in a huff. Our relations have suffered as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME800099;Nationalist Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC800099;Nationalist rebels have successfully seceded from $COUNTRY$. Their young nation, however, is still very much in chaos and vulnerable to attack. Their leaders have approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, hopeful for a reconciliation now that they have proven their mettle. It falls to us to decide if we will recognize the loss of territory, and perhaps gain an ally, or fight to retake what we have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16050214;Retreat to Taiwan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050214;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan. The suggestion among what little remains of the Kuomintang government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taipei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.  We shall however never relinquish our rightful claim to the mainland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16050215;Victory over the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16050215;With their armies deafeated, their provinces occupied and their government retreating to Taiwan it has become clear that the Kuomintang no longer has the will to fight.  We may now claim dominance over China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95501;The Scramble for Africa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95501;A conference has been held in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attended by all colonial powers, to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa. A general agreement has been reached, formalizing the scramble for the African continent. After this point, any civilized country will largely be seen as justified in aggression towards uncivilized African nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC200002;Although some questioned the wisdom of our policy of integrating the natives cultures into our society, it has become clear in recent years that this policy has paid off. There can be no question that the native peoples are fully part of our state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10400;The French Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10400;The unrest in France hit its height recently, with crowds streaming through the streets of Paris and erecting barricades. In what was widely regarded as an accident, a French guardsmen fired his musket on the citizens and set off a massacre. The resulting conflagaration has swept the city, with crowds chanting 'Long live the Reform!' and 'Down with the King!'. Despite assurances that everything is under control, the king has abdicated and fled the country… leaving a provisional government to step in and declare the Second Republic.\n\nNow we have the task of building this new government, starting with a presidential election to determine its new Head of State. Considering the popularity of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte among the masses, and the granting of universal voting rights, some are concerned that he may in fact take the leadership. If he does, who knows what this may mean for France?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10401;The Presidential Election;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10401;While it was expected that Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte would do well in the French presidential election, no one could have counted on the fact that he has done as well as this. Despite his autocratic leanings and lack of allies in Paris, he has managed to be something to everyone… even gaining the sponsorship of the Orleanists. The provisional government's candidate, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, led the effort to quell an uprising in the city-- leading to resentment among the masses which has translated into Napoleon's landslide. Many fear the man takes too much after his infamous uncle, and thus the idea has arisen of fixing the elections to ensure Cavaignac's victory. This would require us to restrict universal sufferage, as well as muffle the newspapers and political opponents. Either way, the ideals of the Second Republic seem at risk of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10402;Napoleon Wins Election!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10402;Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte has swept into power as France's new Head of State. The man carries with him the legacy of his infamous uncle, and with it the support of the masses. He has no friends in Paris, however, almost all of whom are nervous of the possibility that he might decide to follow in his uncle's footsteps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10405;Louis-Napoleon's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10405;Unable to force the Upper House to repeal its prohibition against presidential re-election and facing removal from power, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10410;Emperor Napoleon Deposed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10410;The popularity of Louis-Napoleon has waned. Where once it was expected that his ascension would return France to the greatness it experienced during the reign of his uncle, instead France sees itself being eclipsed by its neighbours. The Emperor has cultivated many enemies among the liberals in Paris, and now they have chosen their moment to strike. Napoleon has been deposed, and the only question remains as to what form France shall now take. Shall we restore the Bourbon dynasty under the Count of Chambord, elect for a Bourbon constitutional monarchy under the Comte de Paris, or instead opt to create the Third Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME10411;The Death of Napoleon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC10411;Louis-Napoleon has grown ill in recent months, slowly surrendering more and more ground to the Upper House. Thus his death comes with no surprise to many. Mourned by the entire nation, and by his beloved Empress Eugénie, the question now turns to who will follow him. His son and heir would be Napoleon IV… but he is still a young man, eager to live up to the legacy left him. Others favor the popular Bourbon Count of Paris. Still more, however, claim this is the perfect moment to restore the republic and end the monarchy once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11115;The Greater Slavic Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11115;Many within the $COUNTRY$ have always considered it a dream to form a greater union of the Slavic peoples, one spanning all of the Balkans and uniting them under a common flag. Such a nation would be far better suited at resisting the encroachment of foreign powers into the region. Now seems like the perfect opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to form such a union. Do we proceed with the creation of Yugoslavia, or let the dream die here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME11120;Slavic Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC11120;The call has come to $COUNTRY$ to unite with Yugoslavia, a union of Slavic countries interested in protecting the Balkans from the encroachment of other European powers.

EVTDESC13056;The great clippers ply our coastlines from north to south, like wolves culling out the weak and the corruptible with the poison they sell.

EVTNAME16002;Fort Sumter Fired Upon!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16002;While debate has been raging in $CAPITAL$ regarding whether to negotiate with the Confederacy, loyal American troops within Confederate territory have been on the move and preparing for the worst. One battalion relocated to Fort Sumter and proceeded to ignore Confederate demands for their immediate withdrawal.

All hopes for a peaceful settlement have now ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16500;Second Constitutional Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16500;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests. This has led to demands for a second constitutional convention and a change to a more proportional system of government based on population-- a demand adamantly opposed by the south, and not universally supported even in the north.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16501;Dissatisfaction in the North;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16501;Delegates from the northern states are growing increasingly impatient with the deadlock in the senate on the issue of slavery, citing what they see as an unreasonable balance of power currently controlled by southern interests. Despite the move to more proportional government, things have not changed and thus there is talk that perhaps it is the north that needs to secede into a new union based on the freedom of men.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16505;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. In fact, all over $STATENAME$ there is talk of secession, fueled by outrage over the changes to the American constitution which have stripped states of their equality.

EVTDESC16506;Talk of secession from the Union can be heard on the streets of $PROVINCENAME$.

EVTNAME16510;The Free States of America;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16510;A convention of northern delegates have convened in Philadelphia to announce the formation of a new union: the Free States of America, free of slavery and dedicated to true freedom for all men. The 'true' American government has decreed this the act of traitors, and is considering whether a peaceful resolution through negotiation is even possible. The so-called Free American government, however, is calling on patriots to rebel against a government held hostage to southern aristocrats and hidebound thinking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16511;While debate has been raging in $CAPITAL$ regarding whether to negotiate with the Free States, loyal American troops within Free State territory have been on the move and preparing for the worst.

All hopes for a peaceful settlement have now ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME16515;The Union Sundered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC16515;The civil war is over... and we have lost. The United States of America that was is now gone. Delegates in $CAPITAL$ have convened to urge the government to put aside the former constitution, declaring it irrelevant for the reality that now faces us. A new constitution is being drafted, one heralding our place as master of the South, though there are yet some who say our destiny must one day be retaken and that not all is lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME31510;A Greater Austrian Destiny?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31510;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater German unification has never caught on in $COUNTRY$ as it has in the north. Lately there are those who say $COUNTRY$'s unquestioned dominance obligates it to unite Greater Germany under a single flag. The first step in doing so would be to form a confederation of southern Germans-- a signal to the north of our change in direction. It would also be a signal to the rest of the world, and to the great powers who fear a united German super-state. Some suggest that, if we are to embark upon this path, we should consider granting autonomy to our non-German peoples in order to convince the great powers we have no designs on the rest of Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31511;Limited Autonomy for $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31511;We have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany.

EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31516;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Petitions to Join Germany;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME31518;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses German Unity!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be first granted independence, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers-- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with the emergence of a united German super-state even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more.

EVTNAME31550;The Serbian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME33025;The Spanish Pacific;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33025;With the loss of our colonial base in Manila, the administration of the Pacific Islands has become incredibly difficult. We have been approached by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the possibility of selling any of our remaining holdings in the Caroline and Mariana Islands. The amount offered is not much, but then again the islands are not worth much-- indeed, they cost us far more than they provide. There is the additional notion that, should we disagree, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might attempt to take them by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36709;While Belgium's de facto independence from the Netherlands had been established by force of arms during the Belgian Revolution of 1831, it has not been confirmed de jure and we yet hold claims over Belgian territory. The British have offered to mediate a settlement-- in return for the surrendering of our claims and a guarantee of Belgium's neutrality, we would receive the Rhenish part of Luxembourg as our vassal… as well as a great deal of standing in the eyes of the European powers. That is, of course, if Belgium even agrees to the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36715;The Fall of Amsterdam;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36715;Despite our best efforts, the unthinkable has happened: Amsterdam has fallen. It seems there is little choice but to surrender to the Belgians and allow them to dictate terms. If they are kind, they will simply force us to relinquish all claims to the southern Netherlands. If they are unkind, they may force us to give up territory-- though doing so will surely bring about the wrath of the European powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME36716;The Dutch Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36716;Our forces have consolidated their control over Amsterdam and proven their superiority in the war, and thus the Dutch government has little choice but to accept any terms we dictate.

EVTNAME36975;Intervention in Egypt?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC36975;We have received disturbing reports of rebellion in Egypt, on a scale where our interests in the Suez might become threatened. While it undoubtedly would appear to some that we are using this as an excuse, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government cannot idly stand by and watch such an important project be laid to waste by the ignorant. We must consider direct intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37750;We have lost the war with the Americans,and Cuba has been wrested from our grasp. The American government has approached us intent on a treaty, suggesting we no longer have the power to hold onto our Pacific and North American colonies.

EVTNAME37751;We Have Lost The War;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37751;As impossible as it seems, we have lost the war against the Spanish. They retain their hold over Cuba and their other colonies. The American people are understandably shaken, but it seems their jingoistic fervor has only increased. A streak of anti-colonialism has arisen throughout the country, specifically targeting the powers of 'Old Europe'. Newspapers are demanding we gear up to liberate these colonies once and for all. If we agree, some fear this may be a tiger we cannot again cage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME43805;The Federal Council of Australasia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC43805;Now that we are a self-governing colony, the question has arisen as to whether New Zealand should unite with the Australian Commonwealth. Many within the government are concerned at Australia's treatment of aborigines, however, and have suggested that if New Zealand was to join the commonwealth they should offer equal rights for the Maori. This might lead to their refusal, but the alternative would be a setback to the years of friendly relations we have built up with the Maori peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC43806;The New Zealand government has approached us about the possibility of becoming part of the Australian Commonwealth. Their one stipulation is that equal rights be given to the Maori people-- out of concern, no doubt, for our historical treatment of the aborigines. Many Australians would be upset if we gave in to their demands, but agreeing would indeed make us a stronger nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44125;The Western Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44125;Mexico is not properly utilizing the lands between ours and the Pacific. It is our destiny to bring American rule and prosperity to all of North America, and our responsibility to take these lands from Mexico so they may flourish. To avoid further war with Mexico, we should approach their government and see if they will consider selling these lands to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44126;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Northwest Territories!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44126;The American ambassador has informed us that it would be in our best interests to sell the lands north of the Rio Grande to the United States.

EVTNAME44140;The Northern Alaska Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44140;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to inquire about the possibility of purchasing our territory in northern Alaska. The land is not valuable, and since previous $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ claims to the area will no doubt only lead to conflict, we should perhaps consider the sale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44141;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44141;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sell the Alaskan territory. Considering that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people already consider the territory rightfully ours, many are calling for war to reclaim the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44145;The Hawaiian Islands Purchase;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME44840;Santa Anna Captured!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44840;In a surprise development, the leader of Mexico-- General Antonio de Santa Anna himself-- has been captured. Found running through the countryside, attempting to escape back to Mexico, he has been imprisoned in a Texan jail and forced to negotiate. We can force the man to agree to a peace treaty-- even though many consider the odds of Santa Anna's own country agreeing to terms exacted under duress to be slight, it may be our only hope against overwhelming odds. At the very least, the humiliation dealt against their leader will be a blow against the Mexican government and one from which they will not soon recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44841;In a humiliating blow to Mexico's prestige, General Santa Anna has been captured within Texan territory-- separated from our army and found wandering the countryside in an attempt to return to Mexico. While imprisoned, he agreed to a series of treaties which recognized Texan independence among other guarantees... all in exchange for his safe return. We are now faced with a question: while the treaties are worthless, disregarding them completely could give the Americans a cause to intervene. Either way, one thing is certain: as the architect of this fiasco, Santa Anna's time in power is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44842;The Treaties of Velasco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44842;While Mexico had every reason to refute the treaties signed by Santa Anna, it seems their willingness to continue the war against Texas has waned. They will not embarass themselves further, and have agreed to let us remain free in exchange for Santa Anna's return. For the moment, this means the war with Mexico is over... whether that peace will continue remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44843;Ceasefire With Mexico;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44843;As expected, the Mexican government has refuted the Treaties of Velasco and refused to negotiate for Santa Anna's return. They are, however, evidently afraid that the treaties have enough validity that ignoring them would give the Americans an excuse to intervene-- and have called for a ceasefire. How long it will last is unknown, but for the moment Texas has its respite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44844;Mexico Ignores the Treaties;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44808;Not unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco-- claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44845;War With Mexico!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44845;Despite the assurances supposedly offered by the Treaties of Velasco, we once again find ourselves at war with Mexico. The ceasefire is, it seems, now over. While many in our government never expected Mexico to live up to the terms of the treaties anyhow, they do suggest that this might be enough cause for the Americans to intervene. Such an intervention would, of course, be inviting the wolves through the front door… but do we have any other choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME44846;The Texan Diplomat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC44846;A diplomat has arrived in Washington from Texas-- a part of the Mexican frontier, settled by southerners who had been offered land by the Mexican government and who then rebelled against its tyranny. The diplomat has asked for American intervention in their war, claiming that a treaty had been worked out with Mexico which they then of course immediately refuted. It seems like shaky grounds… but do we turn our backs on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80103;The Amban's Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80103;The Amban, our Imperial representative from Peking and effectively the governor of $COUNTRY$, has informed our government that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has concluded a treaty with Russia-- a treaty that includes portions of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory, with now must be handed over without comment. Should we refuse, we face war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and Russia both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80110;The Convention of Peking;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80110;A diplomat from Russia has arrived in $COUNTRY$ with an infuriating demand: they wish to readjust the borders on our northeastern frontier, agreed upon almost two hundred years ago. They wish access to a southern port upon the Sea of Japan, meaning all of Haishenwai would be turned over to them. Any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$-claimed territory would be handed over by us and our vassals. This is surely a wicked threat, capitalizing on our current perceived weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80111;The Dungan Basin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80111;Now that the rebellion in distant Xinjiang is finished, there appears to be some question as to who has ownership over the Dungan basin. The western half of the basin, in Qaratal, is occupied by the wicked Russians… but they wish control over the eastern half in Ili, as well. Should we surrender the basin peacefully, or fight for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ honor?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME80120;Hui Unrest in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC80120;Though tolerant of religious practices, the Hui Muslims in $PROVINCENAME$ are resentful of discrimination by the Qing government.

EVTNAME85000;Catholics Slain in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85000;There has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux-- head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church-- and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qing Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessal which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea-- but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qing. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85001;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Retribution;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries-- and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qing tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favor with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85002;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85002;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-- which should have brought our Qing allies to our defense. Frustratingly, and perhaps not unexpectedly, the Qing have responded by severing their ties to $COUNTRY$ and abandoning us to our fate. War with the French seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85003;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abandons Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85003;Not unexpectedly, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to abandon Korea to its fate in order to curry favor with us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC85004;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$-- which has brought our Qing allies to bear.

EVTDESC85010;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the Korean coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal Korean fortress. In a fury, our ship returned fire and then landed a party to battle the Koreans on land. After victory, they returned home-- but word of the assault has spread. This is yet another example of Korea flaunting its disrect for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authority. Many within the government are suggesting we demand not only an apology, but force a treaty upon the Koreans which will see their nation forced to open itself to our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85011;A $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vessel, surveying the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ coastline and damaged by a storm, was drawing near Ganghwa Island in search of safe harbour when it was fired on by the coastal fortress-- who assumed the vessel to be an enemy.

EVTDESC85020;With increasing frustration against government corruption and foreign influence in $COUNTRY$, a rebel movement has appeared among followers of the Tonghak or 'Eastern Learning' ideology.

We will need to move quickly if we wish to prevent them from overthrowing the government or causing an incident with neighbouring powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC85021;The unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored-- for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea-- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85026;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Intervenes in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese-- despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85027;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Forces Enter Seoul;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85027;Reacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. Pro-Japanese supporters have been installed in the new government, effectively rendering us a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal. Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85028;Responding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME85029;Chinese Intervene in Korea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85029;Reacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea-- entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called 'help' from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act-- some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90023;$COUNTRY$ Granted Autonomy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90023;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has finally given in to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ demands for local self-government. Today marks a historic occasion as the new national flag is raised in $CAPITAL$, marking a new era of $COUNTRY$'s independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90081;Egypt Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90081;Egypt has been defeated, and the so-called Oriental Crisis brought to an end with the Ottoman Empire unquestionably the victor. The question now arises as to what should be done with them. There are those who argue that attempting to assume direct control over Egyptian lands would be folly, and that instead we should assume control over the Levant and any lands we have direct claim to... but keep them in our sphere of influence. Others say this only begs for a repeat of the crisis we just faced. They say that Egypt must be turned into an Ottoman colony, rebellions or no.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90082;Rebellion Against Ottoman Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90082;A recent Misri uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ was put down harshly by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces, but the unrest has spread throughout all of $STATENAME$. They are resisting the direct rule of Egypt by $COUNTRY$, and we should expect further problems here in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90083;Anger Over Egyptian Defeat;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90083;Still stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms, and there are fears that if they are not satisified they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME90084;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair-- instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal... $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC90094;Egypt has fallen, settling matters with the Turks through a peace treaty which has seen the Levant taken from them and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Egypt vastly reduced. We can let the matter lie, or fight for both our stake in Egypt and our honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95027;The Liberian colony was founded as a homeland for freed American slaves by the American Colonization Society. Now that Liberia is considered a financial drain on its resources, the ACS has convinced Liberia to request its independence from the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95266;The Congress of $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95266;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Free States of America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95267;The New Confederacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95267;'Whereas once the dream of our rightful independence was crushed, we stand here in the city of Richmond to declare that it has been reborn. No longer can the South remain under the heel of the North and call it freedom-- the Confederacy must rise again!'/n/nWith those words, a large group of delegates gathered in Richmond have declared the Confederate States of America reborn. At least one state has agreed to secede, and its possible that others will join them… now or very soon. If we are to stop this new rebellion, we will need to act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95268;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Confederate States of America.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95269;The Secession of Oregon;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95269;'Whereas once our land was the frontier of America, now it is the frontier of freedom. The Oregon Country is a land where men achieve their destiny through honest toil and while believing in the equality of men. Since the Union no longer believes in the same, we hereby declare it dead.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Portland have declared the secession of Oregon from the Union. While other parts of the region may join them, it's unknown whether everyone there feels the same. Clearly this rebellion must be stopped before it gains further traction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95270;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Oregon Country.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95271;The Colorado Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95271;'We are the true heartland of America. We know things that Washington has forgotten: the value of honesty, the need for virtue, and the true meaning of freedom. What they have put aside, we shall pick up and keep close to our hearts-- for now, a new nation is born. A republic that will stand the test of time as the nation we step away from has not.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathered in the city of Denver has declared the creation of the Colorado Republic. Whether more states will join their rebellion still remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95272;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Colorado Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95273;The Chicago Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95273;'What the fools in Washington have forgotten is that we are not their subjects. We are their allies. If they abuse us, we do not lie back and ask for forgiveness. We leave. That is what we do here today: we are forging a new alliance of equals, brothers with a common heritage who will never forget the evils that lie in tyranny and corruption.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathering in the city of Chicago have declared the formation of a 'New American Alliance'. The state of Illinois has seceded from the Union to create it, and it's entirely possible that others will join them if we do not act quickly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95274;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the New American Alliance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95275;The Dakota Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95275;'Ours is a nation born of resolution. The Washington government thought it could stretch its hand across the breadth of North America, that all they touched would bow down and be forever grateful for their overlordship. We say it is not so, and stand here today to proclaim that there is a better way.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathered in Rapid City have declared the formation of the 'Dakota Republic'. South Dakota has seceded from the Union, and it's possible that others may soon join them. Do they not realize how short-lived their rebellion will surely be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95276;A group of politicians has gathered in $PROVINCENAME$, issuing a declaration that the state of $STATENAME$ would hereby secede from the Union and join with the Dakota Republic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95277;The Pueblo Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95277;'We have been the subjects of despots in Mexico as well as cruel tyrants in Washington, and we stand here before you today to declare that we will stand for neither. Ours is a unique heritage, and we will move forward with the intention of celebrating it in the spirit of freedom and goodwill for all mankind.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates gathered in Phoenix have declared the formation of a 'Pueblo Republic'. Arizona and New Mexico have both seceded from the union to form it, daring us to stop their rebellion-- if we can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95278;The Mormon Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95278;'Our path lies in a different direction-- with our hearts, our faith, and our integrity. May God watch over us and keep us safe in this perilous world.'/n/nWith these words, the leader of the Mormons has declared the formation of the independent nation of Deseret, encompassing both Utah and Nevada. They stand ready to resist any attempt by us to retake them through force.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95279;The Convention of San Francisco;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95279;'Our joining of the Union was with the understanding that it meant something-- we were joining a cause for true freedom in a world full of totalitarianism, a cause far greater than any we could hope to achieve on our own. We were mistaken, and now we must march forward on our own terms. May God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of California met with a large number of delegates in San Francisco and declared their state seceded from the Union-- to the widespread support of many Californians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95280;The Texas Secession;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95280;'We are the Lone Star State. We fought against the Mexicans and succeeded, and now we shall fight against the Yankees if they come. Let them come. Texas bows before no-one.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Texas stood before a group of gathered delegates and declared their state seceded from the Union. Already an army of supporters is gathering in Austin, ready to fight against any reprisal from Washington.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95281;The Convention of Boston;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95281;'We stand here in Boston, the birthplace of this nation and the home of the Liberty Bell. Let the bell ring, let it announce to the world that our beloved homeland has fallen from grace. It is up to the Sons of Liberty to rise in its place, to fight for truth and freedom wherever its meaning has been lost. We will brook no tyrants in America.'/n/nWith these words, a group of delegates from throughout New England have declared their states seceded from the Union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95282;The Alaskan Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95282;'We are the true North, the furthest frontier of the United States. We are a sturdy people who will stand on our own when called to-- and that call goes out to you now. Alaska never sought its independence, but it will stand for what's right. God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Alaska spoke to delegates gathered at Stika and announced that the state-- cut off from support by the rest of the nation-- was forced to stand on its own. Whether the state intends to one day rejoin the Union if that situation changes is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95283;The Honolulu Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95283;'Once we were a nation of our own, but we joined with the United States and have earned our place in the Union. We are a hard-working people who will do whatever must be done-- and now we must act. Hawaii never sought its independence, but it will stand for what's right. God help us all.'/n/nWith these words, the governor of Hawaii spoke to delegates gathered at Honolulu and announced that the state-- cut off from support by the rest of the nation-- was forced to stand on its own. Whether the state intends to one day rejoin the Union if that situation changes is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95610;The Great Game;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95610;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep... And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95611;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion. If we do not press south, Russia will soon have its southern borders exposed to European invasion. It does us no good to allow the British complete hegemony over Central Asia. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95612;The Great Game Comes To $COUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between. Recently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers got into a skirmish with one of our neighbours... and the resulting incident has brought the infernal gaze of one of these powers upon us, perhaps meaning war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95613;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Border Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its maneuvering, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95614;Peace With $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95614;It seems that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is content to accept the incident was not our intent and turn its attentions elsewhere. For the moment, $COUNTRY$ is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95616;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Doctrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95616;Unrest within $FROMCOUNTRY$ against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has reached a boiling point, and it appears the only solution is to step in and rule them directly. Should we fail to do so, we may find $FROMCOUNTRY$ soon taken from our control and turned into a target for a foreign power's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95640;Persecution of French Missionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95645;The Suzerainty of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95646;The King of Cambodia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the French intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the French and asked for protection, and the French have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95650;French Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbours. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95652;French diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the French claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet… do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME95655;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the French onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the French at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97120;Retreat From India?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97120;Our lands in the Indian Raj have been overrun, our enemies among the Indians having successfully driven us off the subcontinent. We have been forced to consider whether we should retreat from India altogether. There are those in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who say the time has come: clearly the Indians wish us gone. Others say we must not submit to what amounts to a temporary setback. The Indians can be forced to submit, if we focus our efforts on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97121;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Retreats From India!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97121;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to an abrupt end. With most of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ India either occupied or in disarray, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has decided to retreat from the subcontinent completely. Governors have been spotted fleeing, leaving colonial mansions completely emptied. While this does leave the nation in a state of relative chaos, a great $COUNTRY_ADJ$ victory has been achieved! India is at last freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME975520;El Salvador Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC975520;With rebels rampant in the south, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in El Salvador. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in San Salvador.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME975521;Honduras Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC975521;With rebels rampant in the south, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in Honduras. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in Comayagua.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97642;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over all of Japan. We have little choice, as they have forced our hand. Either we rise up against the Shogun now, or the Shogun will assume we are behind the rebellion even if we are not. The time has come to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97673;The Path of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97673;$COUNTRY$ has followed a militaristic path until now, determined to set ourselves against our neighbours in the interest of security-- while risking that security with dangerous wars. The new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has determined that this must change. We must follow a path of progress, and instead devote outselves to technology and westernization if we are to remain free and whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97674;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97674;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe. We now see this is in error, and that only by an aggressive expansion of our borders can we hope to maintain the security of $COUNTRY$ proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97675;China in Chaos;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97675;The Chinese have fallen into warring factions, all but crumbling their power and leaving us an advantage we would be fools not to exploit. The Line of Advantage policy dictates that we should strike, and strike soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97676;War With $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97676;Believing $COUNTRY$ to be weak, the hated Japanese have decided to strike at us and take control of our government. They shall find us a difficult target!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97677;The Korean Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97677;Our nation's policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighbouring Korea. They must either be brought under our direct control or made into a vassal if $COUNTRY$ is to be kept safe. Already $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals are clamoring for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97678;The Formosa Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97678;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97679;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97679;After the recent murders of a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ sailors off the coast of Formosa, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has delivered a demand: turn over the island, for the sake of their security, or it shall be war between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$. We know this is just an excuse for their militarist expansion... but can we stand up against their might?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98620;The Young Ottomans;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98620;With the Ottoman government having indicated its willingness to provide reforms, an intellectual class known as the Young Ottomans has arisen-- men influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution who are advocating the assumption of secular rather than religious laws as well as the provision of rights to ethnic minorities. This, they say, will help stem the tide of decay in the Empire. Most recently they have suggested embracing the Empire's Bulgarian minorities, maintaining that such a gesture would indicate a willingness to embrace European values. Mashriqi citizens have gotten wind of this, demanding that they as Muslims should receive preferential treatment. Reactionary officials have agreed, suggesting a move towards accepting the Empire's role as an Islamic power rather than away from it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98621;The Millet System;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98621;Recently the Young Ottomans have been pushing for reform in the millet system, the governmental system under which the Empire's territories are allowed to govern themselves. The Young Ottomans say that the Albanians have been loyal servants to the Empire and their millets deserve equal treatment to those of the Turks. This would also indicate a willingness to embrace European ideals. Reactionaries have rejected this notion, suggesting the Empire embrace the Bedouin population instead. This would indicate a commitment by the Empire towards traditional values.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98622;A Question of Equality;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98622;The Young Ottomans have begun campaigning for equality to be granted to Bosnian citizens-- a European culture which is also Muslim, and the embracing of which would further indicate an alignment towards Europe. Reactionaries have been quick to suggest that if equality is going to be granted to any distant group, it should be the Maghrebi. Doing so would indicate an alignment towards reclaiming the Empire's former expanse and away from Europe and its dangerous ideas. Appeasing both groups appears to be impossible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98626;The Empire in Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants-- and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force-- or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98630;Inspired Nationalists;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98635;The Young Turks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'. They seek to restore the consitutional monarchy, by force if need be, and there are those who have advised the government that these liberals must be dealt with harshly before they grow into a real problem.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98636;Turkish Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy-- to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98640;End of the Ottoman Dynasty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98640;The Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place. The concept of Ottomanism, an Empire formed of diverse cultures and religions, has been set aside in favor of a nation built by and for the Turkish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98650;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Unification!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98650;The call from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come to $COUNTRY$, asking us to unify with their nation into a greater state-- one which will forge a greater power in a new world order. There are those $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who fear losing our identity in such a union, but many welcome the nation and rightly state that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s influence in $COUNTRY$ is already great. If we deny the union, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government may decide to enforce their claim on us whether we like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98655;Hungarians Agree to Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98655;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures even if it means giving up some of their traditional claims to those lands. We may now proceed to propose the union to other local governments with full confidence that both our governments are behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98656;The Hungarian Counter-Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98656;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have agreed to expand the Austro-Hungarian union into a federation with the other Danubian cultures... on one condition: that they be elevated to a fully autonomous state tied to the federation only in matters of foreign relations. We can ignore their proposal, but not without causing a great deal of discontent among the Hungarian people. Sadly, this appears to be as far as their government will go on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98657;The Hungarians Refuse Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98657;After much discussion and deliberation, the Hungarians have outright refused the proposed federation. They do not wish to lose their equal standing with the Austrian government, and see no benefit in surrendering claims to their traditional territories. We can ignore their refusal and proceed with the federation anyhow, but not without upsetting the Hungarian people greatly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98660;Czechs Agree to Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98660;After much discussion and deliberation, the Czechs have agreed to the proposed Danubian Federation without reservation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98661;The Czech Counter-Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98661;After much discussion and deliberation, the Czechs have agreed to the proposed Danubian Federation... on one condition: that they be elevated to a fully autonomous state tied to the federation only in matters of foreign relations. We can ignore their proposal, but not without causing a great deal of discontent among the Czech people. Sadly, this appears to be as far as they will go on the matter.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98662;The Czechs Refuse Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME98665;Romanians Agree to Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98665;After much discussion and deliberation, the Romanians have agreed to the proposed Danubian Federation without reservation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98666;The Romanian Counter-Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME98720;End of the Federation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98720;With the loss of Hungary, the entire basis for the Danubian Federation has begun to crumble. The other ethnic groups are questioning the dominance that the German majority will exert without the Hungarians to counter-balance them, and increasingly there are demands for the federation to be undone. Some Germans are fine with this, preferring to return to the Austria that was, but many of them say that these other groups should not be permitted to break away. They say the Austrian Empire should be restored-- by force, if need be.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98721;With the Danubian government having become a totalitarian regime, resentment among the various ethnic groups has reached a boiling point. They are demanding their independence, something which would see an end to the federation as it currently exists.

EVTNAME1316085;The Treaty of Shimonoseki;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316085;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well. The damnable Japanese are in our lands and blockading our ports, and to the embarassment of our government there seems to be little we can do to stop them. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us to negotiate a 'fair' settlement-- hand over Formosa and pay reparations. While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them what they want, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316086;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316086;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us Formosa as well as reparations. This has improved relations between our countries tremendously, and should go a long way to ensuring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Asia remains strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316175;We have lost all patience with the barbarians who call themselves our 'masters'. They ignore our laws, our customs, and force themselves upon the generosity of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ throne at every opportunity. It is time we turned them out, refused them their free reign in our lands and ports, and demonstrated the true might of our Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316176;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Envoy Ejected;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316176;Relations have been cool with $FROMCOUNTRY$, laced with bitterness over our nation's superiority. Lately the situation has reached a boiling point, and we have received a report that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ envoy to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ court has been ejected. Indeed, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals throughout $FROMCOUNTRY$ are reporting harassment and outright violence. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ are being refused berth at Chinese harbors. This is a systematic campaign by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ emperor to reduce our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316180;Empire of the Great Qing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316180;China has no need for, nor interest in, foreigners and their gifts no matter how ingenious they may be. It is only due to the emperor's generosity that foreigners are allowed to trade at all, and all such trade must take place at our will. The yi barbarians should tremble as they obey us and show no negligence! Barbarians shall bow down before the Chinese emperor in the manner customary for tributary envoys.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316181;The Arrow Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316181;Qing officials recently boarded the Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship (a lorcha) that was suspected of piracy and smuggling. Twelve Chinese crew members were arrested on suspicion of piracy by the Qing authorities. British officials have demanded the release of the sailors, however, claiming that because the ship had recently been British-registered, it was under their protection. The Imperial court has been enraged by this claim, suggesting that agreeing to British demands would give smugglers free reign throughout China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316182;Qing officials recently boarded the Arrow, a ship that-- according to all reports-- was flying British colors at the time. The Chinese claim this isn't the case, and we've received news that they intend to crack down on the opium trade throughout the Empire. The British government is up in arms, saying that we must exert our influence over the Qing if we are to retain our position in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1600010;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared-- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible. If we do not act, however, the rebels will surely gain control over not only the south but perhaps all of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160004;Truce With the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160004;Though we are not yet done battling the hated Manchu, for the moment the Heavenly Kingdom claims victory. We have forced a truce, and now the Manchu will need to deal with rebellions across their land as the people realize their mandate to rule no longer exists. All the world watches us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160008;The Taiping Are Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160008;We have overthrown the hated Manchu and taken control of all China. Now, as the world watches, the true test comes: transforming the nation into the true Heavenly Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160009;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160009;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160012;Taiping Missionaries in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160012;We have received reports of Christian missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'. Their actions would not be so objectionable if they were not also preaching sedition against the Manchu-- and, far worse, though provincial governors have attempted to halt the missionaries this has only seemed to stir up support for them even further. There are sightings of their pamphlets all over $STATENAME$ now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160013;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160013;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $STATENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160016;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160016;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller by the name of Yang Xiuqing has taken to walking the Southlands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160017;Pro-Christian Riots in $STATENAME$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160017;Followers of the 'Heavenly Kingdom' are causing further problems in the south. They are already heavily fortified within $PROVINCENAME$, and many Qing advisors consider it completely beyond our control. Anarchy seems rampant, and all throughout $STATENAME$ these rebels are shouting treason. Can nobody do something about this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160020;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160020;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have spread their influence even further. According to officials in $STATENAME$, the Christian rebels have been spotted in $PROVINCENAME$ and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise throughout the entire state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160025;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160025;Our beloved leader, the glorious and most holy Hong Xiuquan, has passed away-- ascended into Heaven to receive his just rewards from God. Those of us who remain must now look to what will become of the Heavenly Kingdom without his guidance. There are some who say that his son, Hong Tianguifu, should be given the reins of power. Others say that Hong Tianguifu is a buffoon and that a proper republic is the way forward. Still others say the unthinkable-- that Hong Xiuquan's death is a sign that the Heavenly Kingdom has lost favor with God, and that the only way to restore it is restore the Qing Dynasty to the Imperial throne-- without, of course, allowing the Manchu to rule the south like errant lapdogs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME160026;Retreat to Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC160026;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa. The suggestion among what little remains of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taibei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME164602;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC164602;Members of the proto-nationalist Yihetuan Movement, also known as the Boxers, have staged an uprising in $PROVINCENAME$. While the uprising was initially put down by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces, news of the movement's presence has spread throughout $STATENAME$ and already there are more reports of clashes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010011;The Great Irish Famine;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010012;Irish Famine Spreads;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010012;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt-- poor Irish peasants are walking the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, begging for government aid which never arrives, and many are obviously considering making their way to the New World out of desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010013;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$.

EVTDESC1010014;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt--in $PROVINCENAME$, the Irish are gathering in large crowds to receive aid sent by the British government. While they are grateful, times are still incredibly difficult and it's clear many are considering leaving Ireland to take their chances in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010015;The Young Irelander Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010016;Ireland's Opportunity;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010016;Not content to wait until the dust of the war has settled, nationalists in Ireland have taken to the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ to call for the end of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. With our forces engaged elsewhere, their calls have quickly swept across all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010020;The Irish Republican Brotherhood;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010020;The tone among the people in our Irish territories has changed. Many Irish nationalist who emigrated to the United States founded a militant organization called the Fenian Brotherhood there, a group dedicated to freeing Ireland from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control... and now they have formed a sister organization back home, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Already they are stirring up trouble, and it seems certain they will continue until some manner of home rule is attained.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010021;Fenians in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010021;We've received reports that the Irish Republican Brotherhood has been active in $PROVINCENAME$, spreading propaganda and generally stirring up agitation against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. The constabulary in $STATENAME$ has been actively hunting these nationalists down, but considering many within the constabulary are Irish themselves the process has not been simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010022;Fenian Revolt in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010022;The Irish Republican Brotherhood has stirred up local resentment in $PROVINCENAME$, resulting in several riots and a renewed campaign against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule in Ireland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010023;The Easter Rising;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010023;In an event organized by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a group of Irish nationalists seized key locations in the city of $PROVINCENAME$ on Easter Monday, kicking off the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010024;The Sinn Féin Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence. Considering their popularity, refusing would all but certainly trigger a war... but many agree that this is not the way to a peaceful resolution, and that $COUNTRY$ should never submit to such demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010025;The Anglo-Irish Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010025;With Ireland once again under our control, talks have begun in earnest to deal with the Irish situation once and for all... now on our terms, rather than on theirs. The suggestion is that Ireland remain an autonomous Dominion under our control, with any regions that wish to opt out of the new state and remain part of $COUNTRY$ able to do so. Others suggest this is unworkable, and we should either simply release them and keep them as allies or annex them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010030;Charles Stewart Parnell;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he's a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent-- able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It's very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010031;The $STATENAME$ Volunteers;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state-- one dominated by Irish catholics in Dublin. They have begun actively campaigning to ensure this doesn't happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010032;Irish Home Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010032;"Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who-- in the not-too-distant past-- might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable./n/nNow we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way,"" this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1010033;Kitty O'Shea;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1010033;The revelation that Charles Stewart Parnell has been involved with a married woman, one Catherine O'Shea, and indeed is responsible for her subsequent divorce, was the scandal that ended his political career and prevented him from pushing the Home Rule agenda. Without him, it appears unlikely that the Irish Republican movement will gain the political clout it requires to attempt another passing of the Home Rule Bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME1316095;Leasing a Port?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316095;Envoys from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have approached us about leasing a port town on the Guangzhou coast in exchange for a substantial sum of money. The port is of no particular consequence and would never be missed, though we might wish to think twice before giving even more foreigners a foothold on our shores. Still, their proposal is respectful and their offer generous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME1316096;China Agrees!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC1316096;Our offer has been accepted, and control of the port town has been transferred to us. This will facilitate our trade with China and our Asian possessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME32520;The Eastern Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32520;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings in Okhotsk and Kamchatka, and we must seek to claim these lands before the Japanese do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32521;Treaty of Shimoda;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32521;Vice-Admiral Yevfimy Putiatin has sailed from Russia to $COUNTRY$ on a mission to establish formal relations and to define the borders between our respective territories. After months of negotiation, we have agreed to open three ports to Russian merchants and to guarantee Russian ships access through $COUNTRY_ADJ$ waters and straits. Both sides have agreed that our borders in the Kuril Islands lay just north of Etorofu, and propose to share sovereignty over Sakhalin Island. The finished treaty was signed on February 7th, $YEAR$ in Shimoda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA32521;May our empires prosper together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32522;Trouble in Sakhalin;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32522;Conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian and Japanese claims, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. There are several solutions we could propose: first, we could officially divide the island between us and Japan, essentially legalising the status quo. This would be generous of us, and it would improve our relations with Japan. Second, we could push for full control of Sakhalin, offering in return to concede the northern Kuril Islands and make resettlement payments to those displaced. This would represent a modest profit, but Japan might not agree to it. Finally, we could demand full control of Sakhalin and offer nothing in return. This would hurt our reputation, and it would badly offend the Japanese, who would probably refuse. How should our diplomats proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32523;It seems that conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. The Russian recently approached us, all smiles and willingness to co-operate. They have offered to make the current status quo official: Sakhalin will have a border drawn dividing it in two. Considering the fact they could have forced the issue, it seems they want us to be friends rather than enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have proposed an exchange of border territories: we would give them complete control of Sakhalin, and in return they would cede the northern Kuril Islands all the way to Kamchatka. Russia has also offered to make resettlement payments to help Japanese to relocate from Sakhalin. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.If we accept, we will lose a modest territory but improve relations with Russia. On the other hand, if we insist on the status quo, we will keep our present territory but risk escalating the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have outrageously demanded that we give them full control of Sakhalin, in exchange for nothing! Their negotiators hint darkly at Russian ships shelling Japanese ports if we should refuse. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin. If we give in, we will lose a promising colony and look weak to other nations. But, if we insist on the status quo, the conflict is likely to escalate into open war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32526;Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32526;The Japanese have refused our proposal, and they now insist that they will settle for nothing less than the present division of Sakhalin. We can back down and accept the status quo, or we can use force to get our way. If we accept the status quo after reaching for more, we will look weak to the other Powers, though relations with Japan will be preserved. But, our only other option now is to declare aggressive war for the islands, which will hurt our reputation abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME32527;Treaty of Saint Petersburg;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32527;The treaty has been signed! Our borders in Sakhalin and the Kurils are now settled, and ships from both empires have been guaranteed access through the Strait of Tartary and the Sea of Okhotsk. This should ease tensions in the region considerably and ensure close diplomatic ties between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC32528;The war for Sakhalin is lost! Russia has been compelled to acknowledge Japan's sovereignty over the south of the island. One day, we will make this right--- but, for now, we are beaten.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME33030;The German East Africa Company;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33030;The Society for German Colonization has been attempting to colonize the Zanzibar coast for several years now, having formed the German East Africa company and signed several treaties with Swahili tribes. It now seems they are facing difficulty with rebellions and have asked us to step in. The Sultan of Zanzibar will doubtlessly object if we do, as he claims authority over the coast-- even if his actual authority is minimal-- but so what if he does? This may be an interesting opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME33031;German Warships!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC33031;For the last several years, Swahili tribes on the coast have been making treaties with Europeans, allowing them to create small settlements. We knew this would be trouble, and we were right. Powerful warships have arrived from $FROMCOUNTRY$, a demonstration of their power as they make a demand for the entirety of the coast. If we do this, they say, we shall be safe from further molestation-- and they claim we do not truly control the coast anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME37235;The Algerian Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC37235;Not long ago, Algerian bitterness towards Ottoman rule made them almost welcome French intervention. Our colonization of Algiers and the northern coast, however, has given rise to a resistance under the leadership of Emir Abdel Kadir. The man has united the Maghrebi tribes, and now has launched attacks on several colonial settlements.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97666;The Rebellion is Over;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97666;Saigo Takamori is dead-- some say he committed seppuku after receiving a wound-- and the rebellion he inspired is now ended. To many, this was the last gasp of the ancient samurai… and a new way for $COUNTRY$ on the path of progress now lies ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97680;The Sakhalin Question;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97680;Japan has quarreled with Russia before over the rule of Sakhalin Island. Now, our influence in China and Korea has led to renewed friction between our nations. The Line of Advantage dictates that we must extend our control over the whole of Sakhalin and establish a stronger northern border. But are we willing to risk war with a European power?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME97681;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC97681;The warmongers in the Japanese government are now demanding that Russia cede Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands entirely to them. To give up so much territory without a fight would make us look very weak, but Japan's might has grown tremendously in recent decades. Can we risk a war in the Pacific?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME99000;The Righteous Harmony Society;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99000;'Support the Qing! Destroy the Foreign!'/n/nMany Chinese are growing enraged at the continuing encroachment of westerners into the Empire. They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society-- known to foreigners as 'Boxers'-- has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qing Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qing government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99001;Boxers in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99001;An attack upon a foreign merchant in $PROVINCENAME$ has signaled the arrival of the Boxer movement to $STATENAME$. Already the flags of the Righteous Harmony Society have been spotted, their followers recruiting fellow Chinese to support the Qing government in their struggle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99005;Attack on Foreigners in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99005;Throughout all of $STATENAME$, the Boxers are attacking western influence. Smugglers, missionaries, opium peddlers… anyone they can apprehend is being slain or forced to flee for their lives. We have a choice: either look the other way, risking anger from the great powers for these 'atrocities', or send in forces to suppress the Boxers and risk the anger of our own people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99006;Boxer Atrocities in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99006;A group of Chinese nationalists known as the 'Boxers', intent on driving all western influence out of $FROMCOUNTRY$, have attacked a group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several were slain, while others were forced to flee for their lives. Worse, the Qing government has done nothing about it. They are looking the other way while these atrocities are being committed upon our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99010;Boxers Attack Legation Quarter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99010;The Boxers have reached the capital of $COUNTRY$, streaming into $CAPITAL$ to attack foreigners-- and, far more noteworthy, they have laid siege to the Legation Quarter. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries and merchants reside within. If we do not step in to protect them, it will be seen as a declaration of support for the Boxers and an act of war against the great powers. If we do, the Boxers will see it as a betrayal of their cause and perhaps even rise up in rebellion against us. They have forced our hand now, however, and we have no choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99011;Boxers Attack $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Legation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99011;The Boxer situation in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached a head: the Chinese nationalists have entered Peking, laying siege to the Legation Quarter and putting the lives of dozes of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants and dignitaries at risk. The Qing government has looked the other way, an act that is seen by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as a declaration of war. Many are calling upon us to intervene in order to protect $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens from these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME99015;The Boxer Protocol;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC99015;We are forced to submit to the foreign demands, signing a treaty with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ generals and representatives from all the great powers.

EVTDESC900640;An idea has arisen within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: could we perhaps offer our support to the Ottomans in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for a lease on Cyprus?

EVTDESC900641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with a proposal: they will lend their support to us in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for Cyprus.

EVTDESC19801;"Feudalism was a set of political and military customs.  Although derived from the Latin word feodum,  then in use, the term feudalism and the system it describes were not conceived of as a formal political system by the people living in the Medieval Period. In its classic definition, by François-Louis Ganshof (1944), feudalism describes a set of reciprocal legal and military obligations among the warrior nobility, revolving around the three key concepts of lords, vassals and fiefs. There is also a broader definition, as described by Marc Bloch (1939), that includes not only warrior nobility but the peasantry bonds of manorialism, sometimes referred to as a ""feudal society"". Because of multiple definitions and other issues, many now see the concept of feudalism as deprived of specific meaning, which has led in recent decades to many historians and political theorists rejecting feudalism as a useful way for understanding society.";;;;;;;;;;;;;

An alliance of northern samurai, particularly the domains of Edo and Nagaoka, and court officials seized the control of the North and declared war against the Emperor Meiji.

Arronax maintains that the ship is, or was, commanded by a freedom-loving vigilante who has sworn off all contact with terra firma in favor of a free life on the world's oceans aboard his ship. Whatever the truth, Professor Arronax's many detailed accounts of many strange new life forms -- supposedly encountered during his voyage as a guest aboard this strange vessel -- will be a boon for our scientific efforts for years to come.;Le célèbre spécialiste français de biologie marine a été découvert aujourd’hui rejeté par la mer sur une plage du pays : $COUNTRY$.

Quelle que soit la vérité, les descriptions détaillées des nombreuses formes de vie nouvelles que rapporte le professeur et qu’il aurait rencontrées pendant son voyage comme invité à bord de ce vaisseau, constituent un trésor pour la science des années à venir.;Der renommierte französische Meeresbiologe Pierre Arronax wurde heute an die Küste von $COUNTRY$ gespült. Der Professor war einige Zeit verschwunden gewesen, seit er sich einer Expedition zur Aufklärung des Geheimnisses um einen mysteriösen Wal angeschlossen hatte, der angeblich auf hoher See ganze Schiffe versenkte und verschlang. Der Professor ist von seinen tiefgreifenden Erlebnissen schockiert, und seine Geschichte ist wahrlich beachtenswert. Arronax behauptet, dass er bei einem Aufeinandertreffen mit der Kreatur über Bord ging, und dass es sich bei der Kreatur in Wahrheit um ein von Menschen gesteuertes Schiff handle, das unter Wasser fahren kann. Arronax behauptet weiter, dass dieses Schiff von einem freiheitsliebenden Eigenbrötler kommandiert wird oder wurde, der sich jeglichem Kontakt mit dem Festland abgeschworen hat und lieber an Bord seines Schiffes ein Leben in Freiheit auf den Ozeanen dieser Welt lebt. Was auch letztendlich die Wahrheit sein mag, die zahlreichen detaillierten Beschreibungen vieler bemerkenswerter neuer Lebensformen, die Professor Arronax -- vermutlich während seiner Zeit als Gast an Bord dieses merkwürdigen Schiffes -- gemacht hat, werden unseren wissenschaftlichen Bemühungen auf Jahre hinaus zugute kommen.;;;;;;;;;;;

Placing troops in the vicinity should help bring the province under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME67502;Resistance in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC67502;The turmoil in $PROVINCENAME$ is over and control has been established, however the locals are resisting our rule. Violent resistance isn't our only problem, passive resistance is catching on, with workers staying home. Improving the locals opinion of us as well as a policy of full citizenship should help smooth the transition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA67502;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME67503;Integrating $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC67503;With the recent problems in $PROVINCENAME$ over we can begin with the integration of $PROVINCENAME$ into our grand nation. Without the proper infrastructure our administration is suffering, and alas there isn't much we can do to speed up the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTNAME201020;A hidden chamber;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201020;Our archaeologists in Egypt have found a tomb, which seemed plundered by tomb raiders. But when they made further investigations, they found a chamber behind a false wall - full with ancient artefacts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201003;Archaeological expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201003;A foreign power has asked for access to the jungle region of Yucatan. An expedition of archaeologists was send, lead by representative of the National $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Museum. They are willing to pay and are also willing to share some of their newly made discoveries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201014;Archaeological exhibition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201014;In $FROMCOUNTRY$, a major archaeological exhibition is held. Finest artefacts and spectacular items are exposed, and it seems, that it becomes a worldwide event. Our own scientists are ashamed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201015;$COUNTRY$, a backward country?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201015;The last archaeological exhibition was not without it side effects. We were mocked as 'backward scientists'. Without excavations and expeditions, our prestige has suffered in the international scene. To make things worse: we lack even the basics of archaeological science. If we want to catch up, we must better our methods and educate a new generation of scientists. But without practice, we won't get further. As we can't get access to the exotic places of this world, a commission has proposed to gain experience in a local excavation. If we have an organized and professional troop of archaeologists, we may have more chances in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201017;Local excavation;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201017;It seems, that after years of practising and studying, our scientists have found an interesting place, which was mostly neglected in the past. After weeks of work, we have managed to find old tombs of a prehistoric times. Our archaeologists have gained experience and are looking forward. It seems, that we have started our own archaeological project.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201023;Our expedition has found an ancient Maya Pyramid in the middle of the jungle of Yucatan. And even more, our chief-archaeologist, René Emile Belloq, was able to get a holy idol, which was coincidentally in the hand of a fedora-wearing american archaeologist. Unfortunately, this poor man was slained by savages of the local Hovito tribe, as Belloq affirms. Now, this wonderful idol will be our new tourist attraction in the Mesoamerican section of the Louvre!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201025;Expedition members eaten by Dinosaurs?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201025;The members of our last expedition in the unexplored jungles of Yucatan have returned without success. The survivors, emaciated, pale and littered with scars, have lost even their equipment and are happy that they were able to return. But the director of the Archaeological Museum rose his eyebrows, when they were forced to tell, what happened to the other team members, the heavers and the equipment. The leading archaeologists shouted like a maniac, made wild gesticulations and told, that they were lost in a hidden valley, in the middle of the jungle, unknown to anyone. In this valley, prehistoric animals like dinosaurs and other extinct creatures lived and attacked the expedition. He continued his fantastic story, becoming even more exaggerated, and was finally brought in a sanatory. We don't know what happened, but this man has clearly lost his mind. Now we must start from the scratch. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201027;A Mayan Riddle;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201027;Footsteps resound in the hall. Light is rare, only a torch illuminates engraved walls. Silence. You go farther, through a corridor. Observing the plates on the ground, the roots of enormous trees, which break through the collapsed ceiling. An amazing place. You take a breath. A breath of history, which floatens this atmosphere. Then, after minutes of walking through mossy corridors, you find a monumental gate, decorated with faces and hieroglyphs. A short view in your book later, you are able to read what the Mayas wrote centuries ago on this wall. It's a riddle: 'The farmer needs it/ the capitalist loves it/ and builds even factories/ but you hate it./ If you stockpile the/ most useless good in/ the world you will/ uncover the truth.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201028;The Idol;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201028;You fetch your bag with fertilizer. (Every $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist has his bag with fertilizer with him, as everyone knows, because of the famous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fertilizer Decree, which enforces every archaeologist to take a bag of fertilizer with him, because nobody in the world wants to buy it and $COUNTRY$ searches ways to get rid of it.) In front of you stands an altar. Gold sparkles in the glimming light. An Mayan idol. A sceptical look to it. A look to the bag. You weigh the bag in your hand, estimating the weight of the idol. Fertilizer runs out of the bag. It is now lightier. You are waiting for the moment, staring at the idol, the bag with fertilizer in the left hand, your right hand on the head of the artefact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201029;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201029;You are able to replace the idol. The bag of fertilizer lays on the altar. You look in the face of the strange idol, enjoying the beauty of Mayan art. Savouring this moment, only for a little while. Noises. Brutal, loud noises interrupt the scene. You look upward. Something has changed. The muffled noise becomes louder. Something is rolling. Something big. Very big. A gigantic stoneball!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201030;You escape through the corridors, the idol in your right hand, but the trap is triggered. A gigantic stoneball is rolling right behind you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201031;An evil Frenchman;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201031;With a last jump you are able to reach the exit of the pyramid, landing in the grass of the jungle - and cornered by mesoamerican Indios. A voice with a soft french accent sounds in the near. A man in white clothes looks at you, amused by your escape. 'It is nice to meet you. But I think, this artefact should be in better hands than yours.' You are forced to surrender, as the heavers were killed by the tribe. 'Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do' is your only response. Your are able to flee - but without the idol.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201032;Leaving the Pyramid;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201032;On your way out of the pyramid, you clatch at a root in the ceiling. The idol in the left, the root in the right, the stoneball rolls under your shoes, through the corridor, and crushs in the jungle. You slump down, following the devastation. As you reach the exit, you see smashed bodies of Indios, scattered spears and weapons. It seems, that someone prepared an ambush, which was dissolved by the huge ball. Not sure, what happened here, but now, that the expedition was a full success, it is time to return to $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201035;Mesopotamian expedition failed;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201035;The archaeological team in Mesopotamia is in a bad crisis. It seems, that the place of research was miscalculated by the chief-archaeologists. In fact, they have searched for month at the false place, finding nothing and remaining only with dirt in their hands. That is a heavy setback for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201040;Preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201040;The Andes are rough and dangerous. Our archaeologists should be well equipped before we send them in the mountains. A list of goods was made, which the expedition demands. We should prepare 1 airplane, 1 off-road vehicle, 2 units of canned food and 3 barrels of fuel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201041;The expedition begins;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201041;The Peruvian sun scorches our skin. We have left Cusco one week ago, entering the endless lands of mountains. The majesty of the Andes is overwhelming, and the ravines deep like the gorges of hell. Henry, my fellow student from twenty years ago, has joined this journey to undiscovered lands. His nose and eyes are deepened in a book. 'So, this was the way they took?', he asks en passant. 'No wonder they got lost.' My only response is a nod. Henry is an experienced archaeologist, a high regarded personality. Unlike me, he was able to climb the career ladder. They say, that he would be able to find Alexander's tomb in a second, only wandering in it's near - when others dug for centuries, only excavating some old chicken bones. 'The aeroplane is ready', I mention, wiping the sweat from my eyebrows. It's the moment, when Henry puts his book away. 'Aeroplane?', sounds his voice sceptically, 'I don't like them. You know, I get sick in these darn machines. What about the car the government offered us?';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201042;An old bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201042;I follow Henry's advice. I'm the official leader of this expedition, but I know Henry's aversion against these new technologies. When we began with our studies at the university, our professors put us for days in dirty holes, only equipped with a rusty shovel and outdated instruments. Now, everything has changed. The methods, the equipment. Even a car. 'That's a fine kind of travelling', Henry says, leaning in the cushioned seat beside me, viewing the panorama. Maybe I must correct myself - some technologies seem to please even Henry. But than, we are forced to make a stop. A river cuts the hills in front of us, and only an old bridge connects both sides. It is obvious that we can't go on the other side with our vehicle. The bridge seems in a bad condition, only made of ragged ropes. I look in Henry's direction. 'And now? What shall we do?';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201043;Crossing the bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201043;"The ropes make noises, as we have decided to left the car behind and cross the bridge. We have shouldered our equipment. We make one step after another, looking only forward. The noises become louder. 'Maybe that was not the the best idea', I suggest. Henry doesn't give an answer. His hands are trembling. His hands staring to the ropes. 'The ropes! The ropes are ripping - go back, before the whole bridge collapses!"" But his warnings are to late. It seems, that we have overloaded the old bridge, tearing the ropes in pieces. Yelling and cryings later, clutching the salvaging ropes with both hands, we dangle above the abyss, seeing our equipment falling in the depth of Andean valleys. We are save, hanging at the clip, but lost our equipment. An idea comes to our mind: this bridge was an Incan trap. And without our provisions we are forced to give up.";;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201044;Lost in the mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201044;Taking the vehicle wasn't the best thing we could do. Now, that we have been for days in the Andes, we realize that the steep and inhospitable mountains are not made for such a technology. There are no more streets we can take, and we are running out of fuel. Even our provisions are used up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201045;Peruvian Sky;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201045;It was not easy to persuade Henry, but after hours of discussion he indulges. We take the 'Atalanta', an aircraft which the government provided us. After the take-off, Henry takes his diary, searching the bookmark in it. 'Manco Capac', he notes. 'The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state is searching for his remains? I didn't know that there are such optimists in the government.' His voice has turned in a sarcastical mood. Henry searched the last five years for a sign of the legends associated with Manco Capac. Manco Capac, the last glorious King of the Incas. He fought the Spanish in a rebellion. He moved from Cusco to Vilcabamba and made the latter city his new capital. The last capital of the free Incan people. The discovery of Machu Picchu made many archaeologists believe, that there could be more historical sides nearby. 'You should fly lower', Henry proposed, ' we can't see anything.' 'But there is fog, and the mountains are clouded. It is too risky', I reply. But Henry is not convinced: 'And what happens, if we overlook something?';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201046;The crash;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201046;Wreckages lay lounge around. The smell of fire comes from the motor. The aeroplane is battered, pieces of metal gleam in the Andean sun. I can rescue my colleague out of the wreck. Henry is unconscious, but alive. My manouver was a bit too confident,I wasn't able to see the rough cliffs in the clouds. Our journey is over, as I decide to return to Cusco.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201047;A temple? A temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201047;We have won hight. The scenery becomes miniature. Henry, who was at first against this decision, suddenly seems interested. 'Did you see that?' 'What?' 'I bet I saw a temple! Look! There! I'm sure, on this plateau', he points with his finger on the window. A temple! Henry was right. It was buried by the mountains, but here in the sky, from above, it is clearly to see. 'We must land!', Henry becomes excited. 'Immediately!' I see the look in his face. He is a rational and cold mind, but when it comes to an archaeological discovery, Henry changes. It seems, that he can smell this type of things. But I can't share his opinion. The plateau is not the best field to land. It is not very large, and it would cost me a lot of courage to do this bold step.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201048;Temple lost out of sight;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201048;I searched for a better place to land, but when I found it, it was nearly impossible to find the place where the temple was. I made a second round to rediscover the Incan monument, but it was without success. Henry made his own expedition by foot, which resulted in failure. After weeks of useless search, we gave up hope to find the temple again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201049;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201049;I was able to land 'Atalanta', despite my concerns. The aeroplane landed softly on the plateau, and Henry jumped out of the machine when the airscrew were still moving. I follow him, looking up to the temple which is in a surprising good condition. Too untouched to be true. 'On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape', Henry mentions. 'That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished.' I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. 'Any information?', I ask, but he denies. 'That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201050;Breakfast with Llamas;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201050;Manco Capac, eh? You two are searching for the remains of the famous last Incan ruler? Follow me!' A native offered his service. Now we travel through the Peruvian mountains, our equipment and ourself carried by llamas. Henry is convinced, that a voyage with this creature, which were domisticated to reach even the most inhospitable areas of the Andes, will be more useful than the new technologies. But when I turned to him, I saw his grim face. 'Henry, what is the matter?' 'I don't trust this man', Henry answers. 'It would be better if we buy the llamas and leave him instead. For me, he knows too much.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201051;Weren't we here once before?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201051;Days and weeks go by. It took this long time after I realized, that Henry was right with his assumption. This llama leader wanted to trick us. Unfortunately, it was to late. When we wanted to confront him, he escaped with the llamas. It took us days before we were able to return to Cusco, exhausted and without equipment or success.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201052;Through the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201052;Without a leader, we are shift for ourself. The journey continues, but the problem of disorientation becomes obvious. Henry spent five years to examine Incan culture, chasing every evidence regarding the legendary capital of Manco Capac, Vilcabamba. But this area is unknown to him. Wandering through this inhabitated landscape drives us to despair. No ruins. No Incan remains. Nothing. Which direction should we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201053;Lost in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201053;The blue heaven. The golden sun. Grey stones and mountains. Nothing has sense. We don't find the way to a promising archaeological place. We don't even find back home. The Andes are our grave, and maybe one day we will be found by other archaeologists, in thousands of years, making a good sample for an exhibition...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201054;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201054;The sunset brightens the sky in red colours, shining on stones. Stones of a building. On the top of a plateau, an old temple sits enthroned like an Incan god-king above the Andes. I tether the llamas, but Henry keeps going forward. 'On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape', he mentions. 'That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished.' I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. 'Any information?', I ask, but he denies. 'That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201055;War interrupts expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201055;The communication between our expedition in Peru and our archaeological society is interupted. Until the war goes on, our enemies will try to disturb every information exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201056;Expedition in Peru responds again;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201056;Immedietly after the end of the war, the expedition in Peru has contacted us again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201037;Tutankhamun's Tomb discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201037;The discovery of this archaeological sensation is an international event. What should we do now, regarding the Great powers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201038;El Mirador discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201039;The Tower of Babel discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201058;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201058;We searched for hours, but we didn't find the entrance. A huge portal marks an area, which we identify as a possible gate, but it it is closed by a huge stone slab. Knots of alpaca hair is hanging above us, corded in strange knots. 'A quipu! At least something.' Henry seems facilitated. The Incas wrote their messages in a complicated systems of knots, why we call them also 'talking knots'. Henry is able to decipher it, but his look is confused. 'But... that can be true. The most quipus were conserved in the coast regions. In the mountains, nearly 90% are rotten.' 'Henry, please, continue the translation', I interrupt. 'We have later time for these investigations.' Henry grumbles, cathces a breath. Than he proceeds: 'Sacrifice the flesh of an animal/ the flesh of a tree/ the flesh of the sea/ and the flesh of the earth./ Finally, after five pounds of llama wool/ you will see Intis sun.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201059;The Labyrinth;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201059;We gathered the asked goods. The are forced to give up our provisions, and I sacrifice my golden pocket watch, to fullfill the 'flesh of a god' part. Lastly, we lay the llama pelts, which we took with us - fearing the cold of the night in the Andes - to the other pieces of the sacrifice, in front of the slab. 'That is ridiculous', Henry delivers. 'What comes next? Will Inti step down from the sky and open the door?' 'Do you have a better idea?' 'Maybe not a better one, but at least not so dumb like this unscientific proposal!' I want to respond, but the sound of a shattering rock breaks in. The ground trembles, shakes, and rips. The food and the wool vanish in a dark hole, together with dust and gravel. After a moment of shoke, we decide to climb down. Henry takes his rope, and after a while, we abseil in the darkness. The spark of a torch later, we stare at corridors, stairs, different floors and bizarre constructions. I never saw such an amazing compilation of dizziyng architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201060;Donwstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201060;After a hard downfall, we realize, that we are cought in a pit. I grab the torch, fire is enlightning the environment again. 'Henry?' 'Yes?' 'Why is the ground moving?' Silence follows. I lower the torch - we are surrounded by snakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201061;Upstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201061;We reach a higher level, following a passage through a tunnel. 'Something seems… similar', I notice. 'What?', Henry asks - following a strange sound, like a switch, which is now activated...;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201062;It's a Trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201062;AHHHHHH!' Our screams echoes in the labyrinth, followed by the sound of the gigantic stoneball behind us. At least, we are able to escape in a save corridor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201063;The corridor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201063;Reconsidering our situation, taking the corridor was a bold step. Everything seems confusing, and when we go upstairs, it seems that we go downstairs. Each step could be a trap. And there are many different routes we can chose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201064;Lost in the Temple;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201064;Right. Left. Left. Right. Upstairs. Downstairs. Deadlock. Return. Right. Upstairs. Deadlock. Return. Return. Left. Right. Corridors, scales, floors - everywhere. I give up. We are completly lost in this strange place. There is no exit, no way out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201065;The Sanctuary;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201065;A wide hall. Symbols and scenes decorate the walls. It seems, that we have left the labyrinth. We look up, to the ceiling, higher than 20 feet. Snakes, made of stone, surround a portal on the other side. He sits on a bench, a plate on his thighs - the food on it, which we 'sacrified'. He is skinny and old. He notices us, but doesn't react. While he is eating, we come nearer. 'Im sure, that behind this portal, there is something very imporant', I say to Henry. 'Clearly. An old, skinny man is guarding it. Every important chambered is guarded ba an old, skinny, mysterious. Hell, he lacks only a long white beard and a crusader-sword!' Henry...', I try to . Henry can become very sarcastic in such situation. 'And he is eating our provision!' 'Please, please... don't be so loud, my ears', quits the old man his meal. 'If you calm down, I'm willing to answer your questions. This is the Temple of the Sun. A holy place. And I'm the guard of the heritage of our progenitors.';;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME201066;The Decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC201066;It's the duty of my family to protect this place', he begins. 'Since generations, one man in one generation takes it on. The people from the near villages come to this sanctuary, bringing food and clothes, so I can concentrade on my service. But, times are changing. And I can't protect a culture which will die. The young people in the Andes are not interested in our past or our religion.' He stands up, nodding, than he looks to us. 'I know what you want. But do you really know what you want?' 'Oh that is such a cliché. An old mysterious man is protecting an ancient place, all his life, and then, when - casually - two archaeologists come around, he spends time on philosphical phrases...' 'Henry!' 'It is true!', my colleague underlines. The old man grins. 'Anyway', he begins, 'what are you going to do?';;;;;;;;;;;;;

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that this is, in fact, not the case, and, effectively, that the property rights of slave-owners are protected regardless of where in the Union the slave resides. The case has caused enormous alarm among northern abolitionists, who see it as the first step to a full extension of the institution of slavery to the whole Union.;;Dred Scott, einmal ein Sklave, immer ein Sklave' -- Dred Scott v.

Der oberste Gerichtshof der USA entschied jedoch, dass dies nicht der Fall sei, und dass die Besitzrechte von Sklavenhaltern geschützt sind, egal wo in der Union der Sklave lebt.

Deshalb stellte die Sklaverei vor allem eine Bedrohung der Bürgertugenden der Nation dar. Heute haben die Süd-Senatoren im Repräsentantenhaus einen Gesetzentwurf blockiert.

Sein Einfluss auf das wachsende nationale Bewusstsein bezüglich der Sklavenfrage war derart, dass Abraham Lincoln bei seinem Treffen mit der Autorin zu Beginn der Bürgerkriegs 'Sie sind also die kleine Frau, die diesen großen Krieg verursacht hat' gesagt haben soll. Die Veröffentlichung von Onkel Toms Hütte hat das nationale Bewusstsein bezüglich der Sklavenfrage erhöht.;;;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC16310;In a ruling delivered today, the Supreme Court has decided that the slaves involved in the violent rebellion aboard the Spanish schooner 'Amistad' of 1839, later apprehended near Long Island, New York, were merely, in light of the outlawing of the trans-atlantic slave trade, acting in defense of their personal liberty. The case is viewed as a landmark victory for the abolitionist movement, and public awareness over the slavery issue is rising.;;Der oberste Gerichtshof hat heute entschieden, dass die Sklaven, die in den brutalen Aufstand an Bord des spanischen Schoners 'Amistad' im Jahr 1839 verwickelt waren und später nahe Long Island, New York, verhaftet wurden, im Lichte der Ächtung des transatlantischen Sklavenhandels lediglich zur Verteidigung ihrer persönlichen Freiheit gehandelt hatten.

EVTDESC31308;The Zimmerwald conference of the Socialist International, which convened on September 4 1915, , was the first such meeting to follow the outbreak of the Great War in August of 1914. Whereas the previous meeting of the International, held in Basel in November 1912, had looked forward to the possibility of war as an opportunity to overturn the capitalist order, the horrendous casualities produced by the fighting led delegates at the Zimmerwald conference to denounce the war as the result of imperialism and called upon workers to resist its prosecution. Many prominent leaders of the Socialist movement gathered for this meeting, including Lazzari and Modigliani from Italy, Lenin and Bobrow from Russia, the Germans Ledebour and Hoffmann, French socialists Bourderon and Merrheim and many more.;;Die Zimmerwald-Konferenz der Sozialistischen Internationalen vom 4.

Die schrecklichen Verluste führten bei der Zimmerwald-Konferenz schließlich aber dazu, dass die Delegierten den Krieg als Folge des Imperialismus denunzierten und die Arbeiter zum Widerstand aufriefen. An dieser Versammlung nahmen viele berühmte Sozialisten teil, unter anderem Lazzari und Modigliani aus Italien, Lenin und Bobrow aus Russland, Ledebour und Hoffmann aus Deutschland, Bourderon und Merrheim aus Frankreich und viele andere. ;Conferencia socialista en Zimmerwald;Conferenza socialista a Zimmerwald;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC32505;In 1880, Fyodor Dostoevsky completed his magnum opus, 'The Brothers Karamazov'. One of the most arresting works in the entire history of literature, 'The Brothers Karamazov' was a comedy that developed the major themes of Dostoevsky's post-Socialist career as a writer. A comedy, perhaps, but arguably the most serious comedy ever written. In his memoir, 'The Diary of a Writer', Dostoevsky dismissed leftist criticisms of his work by remarking that no leftist had ever provided as damaging a critique of Christianity as his Chapters 'Rebellion' and 'The Grand Inquisitor' in The Brothers Karamazov. Dostoevsky's works were hugely influential not only in Russia but also throughout the West,  and not only in literary circles, but in philosophical and religious ones as well.;;1880 vollendete Fjodor Dostojewski die Arbeit an seinem Opus Magnum 'Die Brüder Karamasow'. Bei diesem Buch, einem der fesselndsten literarischen Werke der Menschheitsgeschichte, handelt es sich um eine Komödie, die sich um Dostojewskis post-sozialistische Karriere als Autor dreht. Es ist jedoch eine der ernstesten Komödien, die jemals geschrieben wurde. Dostojewski schmetterte in seinen Memoiren 'Tagebuch eines Autors' linke Kritik ab, indem er bemerkte, dass kein Linker jemals solch aufrüttelnde Kritik an der Christenheit geübt hätte, wie es in den Kapiteln 'Rebellion' und 'Der Großinquisitor' von 'Die Brüder Karamasow' getan worden wäre.

Puede que se tratase de una comedia, pero tal vez fuera la comedia más seria jamás escrita. En sus memorias, 'El diario de un escritor', Dostoievski rechazó las acusaciones de la izquierda a su trabajo diciendo que ningún izquierdista había escrito una crítica del cristianismo más devastadora que los capítulos 'Rebelión' y 'El Gran Inquisidor' de los hermanos Karamazov. Las obras de Dostoievski tuvieron una gran influencia, no sólo en Rusia, sino en todo occidente, y no sólo en círculos literarios, sino también filosóficos y religiosos.;Nel 1880 Fedor Dostoevski terminò la sua più grande opera, 'I fratelli Karamazov'. Il romanzo, una delle opere più suggestive della storia della letteratura, era una commedia che sviluppava i temi della sua carriera di scrittore post-socialista. Si trattava di una commedia, certo, ma era la commedia più seria che fosse mai stata scritta. Nella sua autobiografia 'Diario di uno scrittore', l'autore rigettava le critiche che la sinistra aveva avanzato al suo lavoro sottolineando che nessuno scrittore di sinistra aveva mai fornito una critica della cristianità confronabile ai suoi capitoli 'Ribellione' e 'Il grande inquisitore'. Le opere di Dostoevski esercitarono una grande influenza non solo in Russia ma in tutto l'Occidente, e non solo nei ciroli letterari ma anche in quelli filosofici e religiosi.;;;;;;;;;

EVTDESC35700;Pope Leo XIII's encyclical on the 'Rights and Duties of Capital and Labour' began with the words 'Rerum Novarum'. In the encyclical's analysis, the spirit of socialist revolutionary change had begun to pervade ever more areas. The causes of the conflict, it claimed, were clear: The vast expansion of industrial pursuits, the changed relations between masters and workmen, the accumulation of enormous fortunes by a few individuals and the utter poverty of the masses, and the prevailing moral degeneracy.  The encyclical argued that Socialism threatened the religious and moral foundation of the state and sought to break the common interests of the Church and State, the employer and the employed, and replace them with an evil, atheist doctrine. To counter this threat, associations must be formed that satisfy the needs of progress and yet protect the weak. The encyclical quoted the Apostle Paul saying that 'Charity is patient, is kind ... seeketh not her own ... suffereth all things ... endureth all things'.;;Die Enzyklika von Papst Leo XIII. über die 'Rechten und Pflichten des Kapitals und der Arbeit' beginnt mit den Worten 'Rerum Novarum'. Der Geist der sozialistischen Revolution hat sich in immer mehr Gebieten verbreitet. Die Ursachen für die Konflikte sind klar: Die starke Ausdehnung industrieller Interessen, das veränderte Verhältnis zwischen Herren und Arbeitern, der enorme Reichtum einzelner Individuen, völlige Armut der Massen und die herrschende moralische Entartung. Der Sozialismus bedroht das religiöse und moralische Fundament der Kirche und scheint mit den allgemeinen Interessen der Kirche, des Staats, der Arbeitgeber und der Arbeitnehmer zu kollidieren und sie durch eine böse atheistische Doktrin zu ersetzen. Es müssen Vereinigungen geschaffen werden, die sowohl den erforderlichen Fortschritt befriedigen als auch die Schwachen beschützen können.

El espíritu del cambio revolucionario socialista ha invadido un número cada vez mayor de áreas. Las causas de los conflictos están claras: la tremenda expansión de las empresas industriales, en las transformadas relaciones entre patrones y trabajadores, en las enormes fortunas de unos pocos individuos y la total pobreza de las masas y en la imperante degeneración moral. El socialismo amenaza los cimientos religiosos y morales del estado y pretende causar una ruptura en los intereses que comparten la iglesia, el estado, el patrón y el empleado, y los sustituye con una perversa doctrina atea. Deben nacer asociaciones que satisfagan las necesidades del progreso pero que protejan a los débiles. Como dice el apóstol San Pablo, 'La caridad es paciente, es amable... no busca lo suyo... sufre todas las cosas... soporta todas las cosas'.;L'enciclica di papa Leone XIII sui 'diritti e doveri del capitale e della manodopera' inizia con le parole 'Rerum Novarum'. Lo spirito del movimento rivoluzionario socialista ha conquistato sempre nuove aree. Le cause dei conflitti sono evidenti: la grande espensione delle industrie, le mutate relazioni tra padroni e operai, le enormi fortune accumulate da pochi individui, la grande povertà delle masse e la degenerazione morale dominante. Il socialismo minaccia le fondamenta morali e religiose dello stato e cerca di spezzare gli interessi comuni di Chiesa, Stato, datori di lavoro e lavoratori, sostituendoli con una nefasta dottrina atea. Devono essere create delle associazioni che soddisfino il bisogno di progresso ma proteggano anche i più deboli.

EVTDESC44100;In 1885 Mark Twain published 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' and completely revolutionized American fiction. Up until its publication, American fiction had tended to utilize the form and language of its European predecessors -- Mark Twain fired a shot in the name of linguistic independence by beautifully depicting the speech of the American illiterate and unenfranchised. The book was clearly an attempt to show how peoples of all kinds are worthy of respect due to their actions and not their status. At the time, it caused an uproar because of its unconventional form and its theme was mostly ignored. Even today people seem to miss the point.;;1185 veröffentlichte Mark Twain sein Buch 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' und revolutionierte die amerikanische Belletristik damit vollkommen. Bis zur Veröffentlichung dieses Werk tendierte die amerikanische Belletristik nämlich dazu, die Form und Sprache der europäischen Belletristik nachzuahmen. Mark Twain stellte sich in den Dienst der sprachlichen Unabhängigkeit, indem er die Sprache der amerikanischen Analphabeten und Unfreien wunderschön darstellte. Das Buch war ganz klar ein Versuch, zu zeigen, dass alle Menschen ganz gleich ihres Status aufgrund ihrer Taten Respekt verdienen. Zu jener Zeit führte das Werk aufgrund seiner unkonventionellen Form jedoch zu einem Aufruhr,  seine Thematik wurde dabei weitgehend ignoriert. Selbst heute scheinen manche Leute den Sinn dieses Buches noch nicht zu begreifen.;Las aventuras de Huckleberry Finn;Le avventure di Huckleberry Finn;;;;;;;;;

Hasta su publicación, la literatura de ficción americana había tendido a utilizar la forma y el lenguaje de sus predecesoras europeas. Mark Twain rompió una lanza en nombre de la independencia lingüística al utilizar el lenguaje de los analfabetos y americanos de condición humilde. El libro constituía un claro intento de mostrar que la gente de toda condición es merecedora de respeto en base a sus actos y no a su clase social. En su momento causó un escándalo debido a su estilo poco convencional, y, por lo general, su mensaje fue ignorado. Incluso hoy en día hay gente que no se da cuenta.;Nel 1885 Mark Twain pubblicò 'Le avventure di Huckleberry Finn' e rivoluzionò la letteratura americana. Fino alla sua pubblicazione, la narrativa statunitense tendeva a usare la forma e il linguaggio dei suoi predecessori europei: Mark Twain, in nome dell'indipendenza linguistica, riprodurre in modo eccezionale la lingua parlata degli americani incolti e privi di diritto di voto. Il libro era evidentemente un tentativo di mostrare come ogni genere di persona sia degna di rispetto per le proprie azioni e non per il proprio status sociale. All'epoca il romanzo suscitò scandalo a causa della sua forma inconvenzionale e dei suoi temi fino ad allora ignorati. Ancora oggi non tutti sembrano averlo capito.;;;;;;;;;

In it he asserted that law was not logical, but rather the will of the judge tempered by circumstances, or,  as its most famous maxim put it, The Life of the law has not been logic, but experience. It quickly became a classic and Holmes was appointed to a professorship at Harvard the next year and was eventually made a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The publication of The Common Law signalled the rise of pragmatism among American intellectuals and presaged a growing distrust of moralism after the horrible slaughter of the Civil War.;;Im Jahr 1861 veröffentlichte Oliver Wendell Holmes das Buch 'The Common Law', eine Geschichte des Gewohnheitsrechts. In diesem Werk behauptete er, dass das Gesetz nicht logisch wäre, sondern eher dem Willen der Richters entspräche, der unter dem Einfluss bestimmter Gegebenheiten gemäßigt wird. Im wichtigsten Denkspruch dieses Werks formulierte Holmes diesen Gedanken folgendermaßen: 'The life of the law has not been logic, but experience.' Das Buch wurde schnell zu einem Klassiker und Holmes wurde im darauffolgenden Jahr eine Harvard-Professur verliehen. Letztendlich wurde er sogar zu einem Richter der Obersten Gerichtshofes der USA befördert. Die Veröffentlichung von 'The Common Law' war ein Zeichen für das Aufkommen des Pragmatismus unter amerikanischen Intellektuellen und prophezeite nach dem furchtbaren Gemetzel der Bürgerkriegs ein wachsendes Mißtrauen gegenüber moralischen Wertvorstellungen.;El derecho consuetudinario;;;;;;;;;;

Se convirtió rápidamente en un clásico, Holmes accedió a un puesto de profesor en Harvard al año siguiente, y acabó formando parte del Tribunal Supremo de los Estados Unidos.

Unfortunately their dreams were shattered when the Hudson's Bay land, which they were a part of, were given to Canada without their consent. In protest the Métis people, led by Louis Riel, revolted. Louis Riel was a highly religious man, who had studied for the clergy in his earlier life. He fought for the Métis people and became a hero in the eyes of Manitobans. Louis bargained with the Canadian government for Manitoba's entry into Confederation. Canadian delegates guaranteed the rights of the people would be respected.

Louis Riel war ein tief religiöser Mann, der sich in seiner Jugend auf das Priesteramt vorbereitet hatte. Er kämpfte für die Métis und wurde dadurch in den Augen vieler Einwohner Manitobas zum Helden. Er verhandelte mit der kanadischen Regierung über einen Eintritt Manitobas in die Föderation.

In early 1885, the situation came to a head when the Métis once again took up arms in revolt.

peking_convention_TPG_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China.  In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;Depuis le traité de Nerchinsk (1689), l’Empire russe a reconnu le fleuve Argun et les monts Stanovoy comme frontière naturelle entre la Russie et la Chine.  Au cours du XIXe siècle, les Russes franchirent cette frontière pour s’emparer des vastes territoires entre les monts Stanovoy et le fleuve Amour. Les Puissances occidentales mirent plus tard un terme à la seconde guerre de l’opium en brûlant les palais d’été de l’empereur et en s’emparant de Pékin. Un général russe avisé du nom de Nicolaï Ignatiev parvint à convaincre les chinois que seul le soutien de la Russie permettrait l'évacuation de Pékin par les alliés. Le prix de ce soutien fut la convention de Pékin, qui entérinait les conquêtes de Muravyov et cédait à la Russie les territoires entre le fleuve Ussuri et la côte pacifique. Ainsi, la Russie gagna-t-elle 560 000 kilomètres carrés sans tirer un coup de fusil.;Seit dem Vertrag von Nertschinsk (1689) hatte das russische Reich den Fluss Argun und das Stanowoigebirge als natürliche Grenze zwischen Russland und China betrachtet. Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts wollten die Russen diese Grenze erweitern, um das weiträumige Gebiet zwischen dem Stanowoigebirge und dem Fluss Amur zu annektieren. Später beendeten die westlichen Alliierten den zweiten Opiumkrieg durch Niederbrennen der Sommerpaläste des chinesischen Kaisers und marschierten in Peking ein. Der gerissene Generalmajor Nikolai Ignatjew konnte die Chinesen überzeugen, dass sie die Westmächte nur mit russischer Unterstützung zum Abzug bewegen können würden. Der Preis für diese Unterstützung war die Pekinger Konvention, die Murawjows Forderungen bestätigte und Russland zusätzlich noch das Territorium zwischen dem Fluss Ussuri und dem Pazifik zusprach. Russland hatte sich also einen Gebietsgewinn von 350000 Quadratmeilen verschafft, ohne einen einzigen Schuss dafür abzufeuern.;;Desde el tratado de Nerchinsk (1689), el imperio ruso siempre había reconocido el río Argun y la cordillera de Stanovoy como fronteras naturales entre Rusia y China.  A mediados del siglo XIX, los rusos se expandirían más allá de esta frontera para apoderarse de los vastos territorios situados entre las montañas Stanovoy y el río Amur. Más adelante, los países occidentales pondrían fin a la Segunda Guerra del Opio incendiando los palacios estivales del emperador de China y ocupando Pekín. Un astuto general llamado Nikolay Ignatiev logró convencer a los chinos de que solo el apoyo de Rusia obligaría a los aliados a evacuar la capital. El precio de este apoyo fue la convención de Pekín, donde se confirmaron las ganancias obtenidas por Muravyov y, además, China cedió a Rusia nuevos territorios entre el río Ussuri y el Pacífico. De este modo, Rusia adquirió unas 350.000 millas cuadradas de territorio sin tener que disparar un solo tiro.;;;;;;;;;

By operating deep inside Free American territory, and by destroying much of the north's civilian infrastructure, Sherman is often said to have broken the North's will to fight. Apply his methods, and it might be the final nail in the FSA's coffin.;Durant la campagne qu'il mena en Géorgie de novembre à décembre 1864, le Major-général William Tecumseh Sherman appliqua une doctrine de guerre totale, que l'on pourrait plutôt qualifier de campagne de terreur ayant pour cible la population civile du Sud. En agissant profondément au sein des territoires confédérés, et en détruisant la majorité des infrastructures civiles de la Géorgie, Sherman est souvent cité pour avoir brisé la volonté de combattre du Sud. Appliquons sa méthode, et cela pourrait être le dernier clou du cercueil des Confédérés.;Während des Feldzuges durch Georgia im November und Dezember 1864 wandte Generalmajor William Tecumseh Sherman die Doktrinen des Totalen Krieges mit nur als Terrorkampagne zu bezeichnenden Aktionen gegen die Zivilbevölkerung des Südens an.

Wenden Sie seine Methoden an - vielleicht werden sie der letzte Nagel im Sarg der Konföderation sein.;;Durante la campaña llevada a cabo en Georgia entre noviembre y diciembre de 1864, el general William Tecumseh Sherman aplicó las doctrinas de la guerra total en lo que podría describirse perfectamente como una campaña de terror dirigida contra las poblaciones civiles del sur. Se cree que al operar en el interior de territorio confederado y destruir gran parte de la infraestructura civil del enemigo, Sherman logró quebrantar la voluntad de combatir del sur.

tanzimat_western_democracy_title;The European Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tanzimat_western_democracy_desc;With an indication of our alignment towards Europe and a movement away from traditional religious institutions, the Ottoman government has the opportunity to fully enact the ideals of the Young Ottomans and the Tanzimat Reforms. This will endear us towards other European powers and ensure they do not undertake any radical notions of partitioning the Balkans, even if it will ultimately upset more radical Turkish nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tanzimat_mixed_title;The Constitutional Era;;;;;;;;;;;;;
tanzimat_mixed_desc;The Kanûn-i Esâsî, or 'Basic Law', was a period of constitutional rule in the Empire promoted by the Young Ottomans and intended to serve as a compromise between conservative religious groups and those more interested in reforming the Empire into a modern European democracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

austrian_form_south_german_confederation2_desc;While Germany was not united until the proclamation of the German Empire, following the Franco-Prussian war, rising nationalism in the 19th century had meant that unification had been on the cards long before that, with the Frankfurt assembly of 1848 being an important forerunner. By achieving a dominant position among the South German states, we can form the South German Confederation.;Il fallut attendre la proclamation de l'Empire allemand qui suivit la guerre franco-allemande pour assister à l'unification de l'Allemagne. Pourtant, avec la montée du nationalisme au XIXe siècle, l'unification aurait été possible bien avant cela, comme en témoigne l'assemblée de Francfort de 1848. En nous imposant dans les États du sud, nous formerons les États du sud de l'Allemagne.;Obwohl Deutschland bis zur Proklamation des Deutschen Kaiserreichs nach dem deutsch-französischen Krieg nicht geeint war, bedeutete der steigende Nationalismus des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, dass eine Vereinigung schon seit langer Zeit geplant war. Ein wichtiges vorbereitendes Ereignis war die Frankfurter Nationalversammlung von 1848. Wenn wir uns eine dominierende Position unter den norddeutschen Staaten erarbeiten, können wir den Süddeutschen Bund gründen.;;Aunque Alemania no estuvo unida hasta la proclamación del Imperio Alemán, tras la guerra franco-prusiana, el nacionalismo emergente del siglo XIX puso de relieve que la unificación era inevitable.

ionian_islands_question_desc;The Ionian Islands had been an amicable protectorate of the United Kingdom ever since the end of the Napoelonic Wars. In 1862 the protectorate was deemed too expensive to maintain, and the islands were, after two years of negotiations, seceded to Greece.;Les Îles Ioniennes furent placées sous protectorat britannique et ce, depuis la fin des guerres napoléoniennes. En 1862, ce protectorat fut jugé trop onéreux à conserver et les îles furent, au terme de deux ans de négociations, rattachées à la Grèce.;Die ionischen Inseln waren seit dem Ende der napoleonischen Kriege ein Protektorat Großbritanniens gewesen.

siamese_border_treaty_desc;Siam includes within its borders a number of conquered peoples: Laotians, Khmer and Vietnamese.

unequal_treaty_DAI_title;Treaty of Hanoi;;;;;;;;;;;;;

begin_line_of_advantage_title;The Line of Advantage;;;;;;;;;;;;;
begin_line_of_advantage_desc;The concept of riekisen, or the 'line of advantage', means that we must extend Japanese influence beyond our national borders in order to ensure our security. This means turning all of the Japanese military, and indeed our people, to the notion of foreign conquest and glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
refuse_line_of_advantage_title;The Path of Progress;;;;;;;;;;;;;
refuse_line_of_advantage_desc;Instead of focusing on military might and conquest, Japanese security must be provided by devotion to technological progress and reform. We must match the Western powers, and quickly, or they will surely take advantage and find Japan sorely unprepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

eth_mission_to_cairo_desc;The strained relations between Ethiopia and Egypt must come to an end. We each have our respective lands, and truly there is no reason for us to fight. At worst, continued conflict will leave both our nations weak to exploitation by foreign powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_muhammad_alis_reforms_title;Muhammad Ali's Reforms;;;;;;;;;;;;;
enact_muhammad_alis_reforms_desc;Muhammad Ali, an Albanian born in Macedonia during Ottoman rule there, served in the Kavala Volunteer Contingent of the Ottoman Army in Egypt during the first years of the 19th century. Following the withdrawal of Napoleon's armies from Egypt Muhammad, through a long series of political maneuvering, came to be elected Wali (governor) of Ottoman Egypt, a position he would eventually use to secure Egypt as his own personal domain as Mamluk power waned. During his reign he instituted a series of more or less popular, and more or less successful, reforms, all aiming to transform Egypt into a modern, european-style, state. The resistance to these reforms will slow down progress for a time, but the benefit to Egypt itself will be immeasurable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

reclaim_alsace_lorraine_desc;The neighboring territory of Alsace-Lorraine is inhabited by German people, and rightfully belongs to Germany. We renounced our rightful claim to it, but perhaps the time has come for us to re-assert our claim and liberate the Germans who live there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_mayotte_title;Annex Mayotte;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_mayotte_desc;The ruler of the small island of Maore, which French traders have dubbed 'Mayotte', is a primitive sultan who only broke away from Malagasy rule in recent years. He has petitioned the French government for status as a protectorate, clearly preferring civilized rule to those of his neighbors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_french_indochina_title;French Indochina;;;;;;;;;;;;;

annex_easter_island_title;Annex Easter Island;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_easter_island_desc;The native population of Easter Island has suffered many devastations in recent years, from attacks by Peruvian pirates to a tuberculosis epidemic. A colonist has operated a sheep ranch there for some years, and recently offered to sell to our government. Considering his ranch covers a large portion of the island, we would be well within our rights to claim sovereignty over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_with_estonia_title;Unite With Estonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
unite_with_estonia_desc;The Estonian people have a historic bond with Scandinavian culture. Perhaps it is time that we extend a hand to them, and invite them to join our nation-- at the very least, we could protect them against Russian adventurism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
purchase_spanish_pacific_title;Purchase the Spanish Pacific;;;;;;;;;;;;;
purchase_spanish_pacific_desc;With the Spanish having lost their colonial facilities in Manila, their Pacific holdings are difficult to administrate and incredibly expensive for them. Considering that our government's interests lie in obtaining a foothold in the Pacific, we should perhaps approach them with the notion of purchasing these islands for ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_new_caledonia_title;Annex New Caledonia;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_new_caledonia_desc;There is some interest within the French government of creating a penal colony-- somewhere that enemies of the monarchy could be sent, allowing them to be far away from the continent where they can do no harm. Admiral Febvrier Despointes reports that the island of New Caledonia, off the coast of Australia, might do just the trick. Considering the British have used Australia for the same purpose, who could object to us doing similarly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;

embrace_bosnians_YUG_title;Embrace Bosniaks;;;;;;;;;;;;;
embrace_bosnians_YUG_desc;The Bosniaks are historically a Muslim culture, and notoriously at odds with the rest of the Slavs. With enough effort, however, it should not be impossible to integrate them more fully into the Yugoslav culture and government. Perhaps this might even mean a future of peace between our peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
embrace_bulgarians_YUG_title;Embrace Bulgarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
embrace_bulgarians_YUG_desc;The Bulgarians often do not consider themselves true Slavs, or perhaps they simply think themselves superior? Either way relations with the Bulgarians have been difficult. With enough effort, however, it should not be impossible to integrate them more fully into the Yugoslav culture and government. Perhaps this might even mean a future of peace between our peoples.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

order_to_expel_barbarians_title;Order to Expel Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;;
order_to_expel_barbarians_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the role of the Emperor has been confined to that of figurehead. We lead Japan, yet we do not. Recently, the leadership of the Shogun has come into question. His increasing inability to deal with foreigners in a way that shows any manner of leadership compels the Emperor to act-- with or without the Shogun's permission. We shall send out a call to the people in our own name, demanding they rise up and throw out the foreigners that the Shogun will not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peace_with_the_emperor_title;Peace With the Emperor;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peace_with_the_emperor_desc;Since the ascension of the Tokugawa Shogun, the Emperor has remained a figurehead. Even so, he is a leader of the Japanese people and, at times, has expressed dissatisfaction with our own position as ruler of Japan. This has caused conflict, and should we reach a point where our positions are not so different-- and, indeed, the Emperor is satisfied with our ability to rule, perhaps we can bring this conflict to an end once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_fiji_title;Annex Fiji;;;;;;;;;;;;;
annex_fiji_desc;With Australian settlers having puchased land on the island of Fiji, they have slowly become insinuated within the court of King Cakobau. So it is that recently, when the king's lavish overspending saddled his kingdom with considerable debt, the settlers offered to negotiate terms by which the British government would pay off the debt and annex the island as a new colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mediate_belgian_independence_title;Mediate Belgian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mediate_belgian_independence_desc;While Belgium's de facto independence from The Netherlands had been established by force of arms during the Belgian revolution of 1831, it has not been confirmed de jure by The Netherlands and technically a state of war still exists between the two nations. The idea has arisen that the British Empire should step in and mediate a settlement, demanding the Dutch give up their claims in return for guarantees of Belgian independence and control over Luxembourg. With the powers of Europe at the table, it seems unlikely the Dutch would refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
invest_in_irish_title;Invest in the Irish;;;;;;;;;;;;;
invest_in_irish_desc;In order to bring the Irish up to par as an integral part of the British Empire, a great deal of investment will be needed-- to not only upgrade the decaying institutions which have been governing the island for centuries, but to also end the system of absentee landowners which so pervades the island's bureaucracy and which makes it a model of inefficiency. Only once that is done can the Irish begin to be integrated as equal subjects under British law.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

claim_savoy_title;Claim Savoy;;;;;;;;;;;;;
claim_savoy_desc;Our condition for allowing the unification of Italy was control over Savoie. We cannot, after all, permit the Italians to have control over the passes through the Alps-- not unless they are under our influence.

north_borneo_company_title;Lease North Borneo;;;;;;;;;;;;;
north_borneo_company_desc;Rights to trading ports along the northern coast of Borneo have been granted to several companies through treaties-- and have recently fallen to Alfred Dent of London. Through him, we may conduct a new treaty that turns these rights into colonial concessions. Considering that the control of the local sultans over these areas is murky at best, and more than one has sometimes granted rights to the same areas, it truly seems as if we are obtaining clearance for the creation of a British North Borneo Company rather than wresting land from the natives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
league_of_three_emperors2_title;The League of Three Emperors;;;;;;;;;;;;;
league_of_three_emperors2_desc;After the defeat of Napoleon, a Holy Alliance was once formed between Prussia, Austria and Russia.

putiatin_mission_title;The Putiatin Mission;;;;;;;;;;;;;
putiatin_mission_desc;The Japanese islands have only recently begun to communicate with the larger world.

french_language_schooling_title;French Language Schooling;;;;;;;;;;;;;
french_language_schooling_desc;A motion has been put forward by the minister Jules Ferry, namely that not only should schooling in France be free-- but that it must be solely in French. Langues d'oc and other forms of patois must be stamped out so that France has cultural unity. That, he says, will give our nation the strength it needs to fully modernize.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

westernizing_2_desc;Our country is under intellectual assault by modernity and the Western World. In the fields of modern technology, industry and military theory, the old traditions and institutions no longer serve us as they used to. Everywhere we turn, western influences spread like wildfire through our nation, our population, and our souls. If we are to remain what we always have been, and not become something else entirely, now is the time to assume control of our own destiny. It has become apparent to the leading members of our intellectual elite, that the only way to turn the tide on the Western Leviathan is to swim with it, for, as Sun Tu says: The reed that bends before the wind, also offers a form of resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_england_title;Claim the English Throne;;;;;;;;;;;;;
form_england_desc;In the Medieval era, the Celtic Britons were slowly pushed-off by Anglo-Saxons from England. They remained independent here, in Wales. After the English victory in the Hundred Years' War, England began to be more and more French. In 1587, l'acte de langage (act of language) declared the french language the official language of the United Crown. The Welsh responded with a massive revolt and declared the Kingdom of Wales that lasted until 16011, when the fortress in Caernarvon fell. Since that time, the Cymry people have antagonized the French foreigners. This is our chance to restore the Kingom of mighty king Arthur and rule this lands independently.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

peking_convention_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China.  In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;Depuis le traité de Nerchinsk (1689), l’Empire russe a reconnu le fleuve Argun et les monts Stanovoy comme frontière naturelle entre la Russie et la Chine.  Au cours du XIXe siècle, les Russes franchirent cette frontière pour s’emparer des vastes territoires entre les monts Stanovoy et le fleuve Amour. Les Puissances occidentales mirent plus tard un terme à la seconde guerre de l’opium en brûlant les palais d’été de l’empereur et en s’emparant de Pékin. Un général russe avisé du nom de Nicolaï Ignatiev parvint à convaincre les chinois que seul le soutien de la Russie permettrait l'évacuation de Pékin par les alliés. Le prix de ce soutien fut la convention de Pékin, qui entérinait les conquêtes de Muravyov et cédait à la Russie les territoires entre le fleuve Ussuri et la côte pacifique. Ainsi, la Russie gagna-t-elle 560 000 kilomètres carrés sans tirer un coup de fusil.;Seit dem Vertrag von Nertschinsk (1689) hatte das russische Reich den Fluss Argun und das Stanowoigebirge als natürliche Grenze zwischen Russland und China betrachtet. Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts wollten die Russen diese Grenze erweitern, um das weiträumige Gebiet zwischen dem Stanowoigebirge und dem Fluss Amur zu annektieren. Später beendeten die westlichen Alliierten den zweiten Opiumkrieg durch Niederbrennen der Sommerpaläste des chinesischen Kaisers und marschierten in Peking ein. Der gerissene Generalmajor Nikolai Ignatjew konnte die Chinesen überzeugen, dass sie die Westmächte nur mit russischer Unterstützung zum Abzug bewegen können würden. Der Preis für diese Unterstützung war die Pekinger Konvention, die Murawjows Forderungen bestätigte und Russland zusätzlich noch das Territorium zwischen dem Fluss Ussuri und dem Pazifik zusprach. Russland hatte sich also einen Gebietsgewinn von 350000 Quadratmeilen verschafft, ohne einen einzigen Schuss dafür abzufeuern.;;;;;;;;;;;

Eventually, it would become the focal point of an intercontinental railroad as well as a major scientific, cultural, and industrial center in its own right. The Czar dreamed that the city would become a hub connecting the west with the east. Perhaps the railroad to Vladivostok will eventually replace the Suez Canal as the bearer of goods and raw materials between the East and the West?;En juillet 1860, le port de Vladivostok, « le maître de l’Orient » en Russe, fut fondé près de la frontière coréenne.  Il deviendra un des principaux ports et chantiers navals de Russie. La ville finira par devenir le point central d’un réseau ferroviaire intercontinental ainsi qu’une grande capitale scientifique, culturelle et industrielle. Le tsar rêvait d’en faire une passerelle entre l'Occident et l'Orient. Peut-être qu’un jour, le chemin de fer de Vladivostok remplacera-t-il le canal de Suez dans l’acheminement des marchandises et des matières premières entre l’Orient et l’Occident ?;"Im Juli 1869 wurde der Hafen von Wladiwostok, oder auch ""Der Herrscher des Ostens"" nahe der koreanischen Grenze eingeweiht. Er entwickelte sich im Laufe der Zeit zu einem wichtigen Handelshafen und Werftstandort für Russland. Schließlich wurde Wladiwostok zum Mittelpunkt einer interkontinentalen Eisenbahnstrecke sowie zu einem eigenständigen Wissenschafts-, Kultur- und Industriezentrum.

Pope Pius IX refused to accept the laws, which were seen by both him and his successors as an infringment of the independence of the Holy See. While the issue was not conclusively solved until the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the Law of Guarantees nevertheless meant that the young Kingdom's capital would from then on be Rome.;En 1870, la « Loi des garanties » fut passée par le tout jeune royaume d’Italie pour résoudre la « question romaine ». Cette loi accordait au pape des privilèges équivalents à ceux du roi, y compris le droit de recevoir et de nommer des ambassadeurs. Le pape Pie IX refusa la loi, que lui-même et ses successeurs considéraient comme une atteinte à l'indépendance du Saint Siège. Si la question ne fut définitivement réglée qu’en 1929 avec le Traité de Latran, la loi des garanties a néanmoins établi que la capitale du nouveau royaume serait Rome.;Mit dem im Jahr 1870 vom neu gegründeten Königreich Italien verabschiedeten 'Garantiegesetz' sollte die 'Römische Frage' gelöst werden. Das Gesetz gestand dem Papst dieselben Privilegien wie dem König selbst zu, einschließlich dem Recht, Botschafter zu entsenden und zu empfangen. Papst Pius IX. lehnte das Gesetz ab, das er und seine Nachfolger als Schmälerung der Unabhängigkeit des Heiligen Stuhls betrachteten. Obwohl das Problem erst in den Lateranverträgen von 1929 endgültig gelöst werden konnte, bedeutete das Garantiegesetz trotzdem, dass die Hauptstadt des jungen Königreichs von jenem Zeitpunkt an Rom war.;;;;;;;;;;;

von_moltkes_staff_reforms_desc;In 1857 Helmuth von Moltke was appointed Chief of the Prussian General Staff, which he soon set about reforming. Among the ideas implemented by von Moltke were a department for historical studies, extensive wargaming excercises and a special department dedicated to cataloging and studying the telegraph and railway networks of Prussia, and how they could be used to best effect in the event of war. The end result was that, by the time of the Franco-Prussian war, Prussia's General Staff was considered the most efficient in Europe, it's methods soon becoming widely studied and adopted abroad. Moltke remained Chief of the Prussian Staff for the next 30 years, and is known as one of the most brilliant military strategists of the 19th century.;En 1857, Helmut von Moltke fut nommé Chef de l’état-major de la Prusse, qu’il entreprit bientôt de réformer. Parmi les idées mises en œuvre par von Moltke, un service d’études historiques, une utilisation intensive du wargame ou kreigspiel et un service spécial dédié à la cartographie complète des réseaux de télégraphe et de chemin de fer de Prusse et leur utilisation en cas de guerre. Le résultat fut que lors de la guerre de 1870, l’état-major prussien étai de loin le plus efficace d’Europe et ses méthodes commencèrent à être étudiées et copiées à l’étranger. Moltke resta Chef d’état-major de la Prusse pendant 30 ans et demeure l’un des plus brillants stratèges militaires du XIXe siècle.;Im Jahr 1857 wurde Helmuth von Moltke zum Chef des preußischen Generalstabs ernannt, den er schon kurz darauf reformierte. Zu seinen Ideen gehörte auch eine Abteilung für historische Studien, extensive Truppenmanöver und eine Spezialabteilung zum Katalogisieren und Studium der Telegraphen- und Eisenbahnnetzwerke Preußens, und wie sie im Kriegsfall am effizientesten genutzt werden könnten. Aufgrund dieser Anstrengungen galt der preußische Generalstab zur Zeit des französisch-preußischen Krieges als der effizienteste in ganz Europa, dessen Methoden man im Ausland schon bald eingehend studierte und nachahmte.

After the failed harvest of 1845, and the following Potato Famine in Ireland, the Corn Laws were finally repealed in 1846.

Après la mauvaise récolte de 1845 et la Grande Famine irlandaise, les lois sur le grain finirent par être abrogées en 1846.

The Old Summer Palace was burnt to the ground by Anglo-French forces during their occupation of Beijing during the Second Opium War.

tanzimat_reforms_desc;Tanzimat' Turkish for 'reorganization' was a series of reforms enacted by the Ottoman state during the latter half of the 19th century, designed to counteract the rising tides of nationalism among the Empire's vast and varied ethnic minorities. The reforms aimed at integrating the various populations under the common banner of 'Ottomanism', by promoting the Ottoman state as an alternative to the ethnicity based nation states that many of the radicalized minorities within the state were, at the time, seeking to establish, and by granting increased representation and autonomy within the state. While the Tanzimat was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the decline of the Ottoman state, it can nevertheless be argued that the reforms at least postponed it.;"Les réformes de ""Tanzimat"", le mot turc qui signifie ""réorganisation"", furent adoptées par l'État ottoman, au cours de la seconde moitié du XIXe siècle, en réaction contre la montée du nationalisme au sein des diverses minorités ethniques de l'empire. Ces réformes visaient à intégrer la population sous la bannière commune d'Ottomanisme en promouvant l'État ottoman comme alternative à l'ethnicité basée sur les États de la nation que bon nombre de minorités radicales, au sein même de l'empire, cherchaient à établir, et en y accordant une représentation et une autonomie plus large. Alors que les réformes de ""Tanzimat"" ne parvinrent pas à prévenir le déclin de l'État ottoman, force est de constater qu'elles le retardèrent.";'Tanzimat' ist Türkisch für 'Neuorganisation'. So wurde eine Reihe von Reformen bezeichnet, die der osmanische Staat während des zweiten Hälfte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts auf den Weg brachte, um den steigenden Nationalismusgefühlen der zahlreichen und unterschiedlichen ethnischen Minderheiten des Reichs entgegen zu wirken. Die Reformen zielten auf die Integration der verschiedenen Bevölkerungen unter dem gemeinsamen Banner des 'Osmanismus' ab, indem der osmanische Staat als Alternative für die auf Volkszugehörigkeit basierenden Nationalstaaten präsentiert wurde, die viele der radikalisierten Minderheiten damals bilden wollten. Die Hauptargumente waren dabei eine stärkere Repräsentation und Autonomie innerhalb des osmanischen Staats. Während die Tanzimat den Niedergang des osmanischen Reichs nicht verhindern konnte, so zögerten ihn die Reformen zumindest etwas hinaus.;;;;;;;;;;;

While originally established as early as 1830, the Legion did not win the lasting legacy it enjoys today until it had seen action during, among others, The Spanish Carlist Wars, The French Intervention in Mexico, the Battle of Camarón, the Franco-Prussian war and, in fact, almost every conflict involving France up until and through the modern era. The image of the young man, perhaps on the run from some personal tragedy, oppression, debt or a criminal past, who joins the French Foreign Legion to serve a tour of personal redemption in the deserts of French Algeria, has since become one of the most iconic and enduring images of the 19th century.

Die Vorstellung von einem jungen Mann, der vielleicht vor einer persönlichen Tragödie, Unterdrückung, Schulden oder einer kriminellen Vergangenheit flieht und der französischen Fremdenlegion beitritt, um durch seinen Dienst in den Wüsten des französischen Algeriens seine persönliche Erlösung zu finden, ist seither zu einer der ikonischsten und dauerhaftesten des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts geworden.

Pourtant, avec la montée du nationalisme au XIXe siècle, l'unification aurait été possible bien avant cela, comme en témoigne l'Assemblée de Francfort de 1848. Dans les années 1860, la Prusse et l'Autriche, qui se disputaient la position dominante au sein d'une grande Allemagne, formèrent chacune leur propre confédération d'États allemands : les États du Sud de l'Allemagne et la Confédération de l'Allemagne du Nord. En nous imposant dans les États du sud, nous formerons les États du Sud de l'Allemagne.;Obwohl Deutschland bis zur Proklamation des Deutschen Kaiserreichs nach dem deutsch-französischen Krieg nicht geeint war, bedeutete der steigende Nationalismus des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts, dass eine Vereinigung schon seit langer Zeit geplant war. Ein wichtiges vorbereitendes Ereignis war die Frankfurter Nationalversammlung von 1848. Während der 1860er Jahre wetteiferten Preußen und Österreich, die beiden größten deutschsprachigen Mächte, hauptsächlich um die Vormachtstellung im Großdeutschen Reich. Jedes der beiden Länder gründete seine eigene Konföderation deutscher Staaten: Den Süddeutschen bzw. Norddeutschen Bund. Wenn wir uns eine dominierende Position unter den norddeutschen Staaten erarbeiten, können wir den Süddeutschen Bund gründen.;;;;;;;;;;;

die_wacht_am_rhein_desc;In 1840, France's then prime minister Adolphe Thiers had claimed that the river Rhine constituted the natural eastern border of the French nation, sparking what would later become known as the Rhine Crisis, as this was perceived in Germany as a threat to Prussian possessions on the western bank of the river. In response to these events, the poet and merchant Max Schneckenburger wrote a patriotic poem calling on the 'Fatherland to remain calm', for, as the poem says, 'fast and true stands the watch at the Rhine', implying that the German nation would defend the river against any and all (French) aggression. The poem was put to music in 1854, and became extremely popular in Germany during the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71.;"En 1840, le premier ministre français Adolphe Thiers revendiqua le Rhin comme frontière naturelle de la nation française. Cette annonce déclencha immédiatement ce qu'on appelle aujourd'hui la crise du Rhin, car l'Allemagne la perçut comme une menace envers les possessions prussiennes des rives occidentales du fleuve. En réaction, le poète et homme d'affaires Max Schneckenburger écrivit un poème patriotique : ""Chère patrie, sois calme. Ferme et loyale est la garde, la garde du Rhin"", laissant ainsi entendre que la nation allemande défendrait le fleuve contre toute agression (française). Le poème fut mis en musique en 1854 et devint extrêmement populaire en Allemagne pendant la guerre franco-allemande de 1870-71.";In 1840 proklamierte der damalige französische Premierminister Adolphe Thiers den Rhein als natürliche Ostgrenze Frankreichs. Damit löste er die sogenannte Rheinkrise aus, da diese Proklamation in Preußen als Bedrohung des eigenen Territoriums westlich des Rheinufers aufgefasst wurde. Als Reaktion auf diese Ereignisse schrieb der Dichter und Kaufmann Max Schneckenburger ein patriotisches Gedicht, in dem er sein Land mit 'Lieb Vaterland magst ruhig sein' zu Ruhe aufrief, denn 'Fest steht und treu die Wacht, die Wacht am Rhein!'. Damit wollte er zum Ausdruck bringen, dass die deutsche Nation den Rhein gegen jegliche und vor allem die französische Aggression verteidigen würde. Das Gedicht wurde 1854 vertont und in Deutschland während des deutsch-französischen Kriegs von 1870-71 äußerst populär.;;;;;;;;;;;

Mortara fut plus tard ordonné prêtre catholique et ne reprit contact avec ses frères et sœurs qu'à la fin de sa vie.;Edgardo Mortara wurde als Sohn jüdischer Eltern 1851 in Bologna geboren. Als er 1857 erkrankte, wurde er von einem katholischen Dienstmädchen der Mortata-Familie auf den Namen Edgardo getauft, da er als Nichtchrist fürchtete, im Falle seines Todes in die Hölle zu müssen. Aufgrund dieser Taufe wurde Edgardo von der Polizei des Kirchenstaats aus seiner Familie entfernt. Daraufhin wurde er römisch-katholisch erzogen, da es Nichtchristen gemäß den Gesetzen des Kirchenstaats verboten war, eigene Kinder aufzuziehen. Dieser Fall bzw. die Entführung führte zu internationalen Protesten, unter anderem von Napoleon III., Kaiser Franz Josef und der London Times. Mortara selbst wurde katholischer Priester und nahm später in seinem Leben wieder Kontakt mit seinen Geschwistern und seiner Mutter auf.;;;;;;;;;;;

the_first_vatican_council_desc;In 1868, Pope Piux IX convened the 20th ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church. The council was convened to address the perceived problems of the modern ideologies of liberalism, rationalism and materialism, as well as to further define Catholic dohma. While the council was cut short by the capture of Rome by the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, it still left a lasting impression on Catholic theology in the form of the formalized Dogma of Papal Infallibility.;En 1868, le pape Pie IX convoqua le premier concile œcuménique du Vatican afin de réfléchir aux problèmes posés par les idéologies modernes que sont le libéralisme, le rationalisme et le matérialisme, ainsi que pour redéfinir le dogme catholique. Interrompu par la prise de Rome par le nouveau royaume d'Italie, ce concile marqua néanmoins durablement la théologie catholique avec le dogme de l'infaillibilité pontificale.;Im Jahr 1868 berief Papst Piux IX. das 20. ökumenische Konzil der römisch-katholischen Kirche ein. Das Konzil wurde einberufen, um über die Probleme der modernen Ideologien Liberalismus, Rationalismus und Materialismus zu diskutieren, und um das katholische Dogma tiefergehend zu definieren. Obwohl das Konzil durch die Eroberung Roms durch das neu gegründete Königreich Italien abrupt endete, hatte es durch das formalisierte Dogma der päpstlichen Unfehlbarkeit dennoch bleibende Auswirkungen auf die katholische Ideologie.;;;;;;;;;;;

By sending the Ems dispatch, we will risk provoking a war with France.;;Die Emser Depesche, ursprünglich als ein internes Memo von König Wilhelm I. von Preußen an den preußischen Kanzler Otto von Bismarck gesandt, enthielt Forderungen, die der französische Botschafter während eines informellen Treffens zwischen ihm und dem König im Thermalbad Bad Ems im preußischen Hesse-Nassau ausgesprochen hatte, und war vermutlich der wichtigste Auslöser in Frankreichs Erklärung des später als Frankopreußischer Krieg bezeichneten Konflikts.

Since then, the American republic has served as an inspiration to freedom loving people everywhere, and has stood as a clear and voiceful reminder to the world of the possibilities of human liberty. Some within France's republican circles have suggested that we celebrate this centennial by presenting to the American people a suitable gift to mark their first hundred years as a free people, and their historical bonds of friendship with the French nation. Vive la Liberté!;;Es ist schon über 100 Jahre her, seit Frankreich und General Lafayette der jungen, tapferen amerikanischen Republik in ihrer dunkelsten Stunde - ihrer Geburtsstunde - zu Hilfe kamen. Seitdem hat die amerikanische Republik als Inspiration für alle freiheitsliebenden Menschen der Erde gedient, sowie als klare und laute Erinnerung an die Möglichkeiten der menschlichen Freiheit. Manche Mitglieder von Frankreichs republikanischen Kreisen haben vorgeschlagen, dieses Jubiläum damit zu feiern, dem amerikanischen Volk ein passendes Geschenk zu ihrem ersten Jahrhundert als freies Volk zu machen, und die historischen Bande der Freundschaft mit der französischen Nation zu zementieren.

Originally founded as the Norddeutsche Schiffbau-Gesellschaft in 1867, the wharf was bought by renowned German industrialist Friedrich Krupp in 1902, and renamed the Germaniawerft. By constructing the Germaniawerft in Kiel, we can ensure that the Fatherland never lacks the ships it needs.;;Die Germaniawerft war eine große deutsche Schiffswerft im norddeutschen Kiel, und Bauort nicht nur von Kaiser Wilhelms II. persönlicher Yacht, sondern auch vieler der deutschen U-Boote, die in der deutschen Kriegsmarine während des ersten und zweiten Weltkriegs zum Einsatz kamen.
